Words: ~8273
============================================================

**[You]** Hey. 
**[Other]** Hey, Alex, what's going on? 
**[You]** Not much, man. Can you hear me? 
**[Other]** I can. Where are you? 
**[You]** I am in a coworking space in Asheville, North Carolina. 
**[Other]** Okay? Wonderful. It looks like quite the vibe. 
**[You]** It is. Definitely. That's the perfect word. It's a little too much of a vibe. Honestly for me. 
**[Other]** You might also get hit by an iced vibe here in a couple days. 
**[You]** Dude. I know. It's crazy. 
**[Other]** It's a little nerve wracking. I've been watching the weather. 
**[You]** Are you? 
**[Other]** We're not in the deep purple like you are. 
**[You]** Okay? 
**[Other]** We're sort of on the fringe up further north, which is good, but my sister lives in Kentucky, and they're, like, right in the middle of it, so we'll see. 
**[You]** It's crazy. And we had, you know, Helene here, like, a year and a half ago. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** Until I feel like everyone, including me and my wife. Are, like, very on edge about it. 
**[Other]** Yeah, well, good luck. Hopefully it's nowhere near as bad. A lot of times when they talk about their shit, it never happens. Then the ones are like, oh, you just get a little bit of snow, and it's like, holy shit. We're all locked in for two weeks. 
**[You]** I know. I know. Where do you live? 
**[Other]** I'm in kansas. 
**[You]** Okay, cool. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** What part? 
**[Other]** Kansas city. Roughly, yeah. 
**[You]** Okay? N. Ice. Are you from that? 
**[Other]** I grew up here for the most part, but then when I graduated from high school, I didn't come back for. Like shit. Almost 10 years. 15 years. So it's only been. We've been back. Well, I say only vivmac for almost six years now, which is kind of crazy. 
**[You]** Okay? 
**[Other]** But yeah, good. 
**[You]** Cool. Sweet. Well, I'm excited to do this. Yeah, tell me. Tell me how. How did you hear about this, too? 
**[Other]** This was a pathless path. 
**[You]** Okay, cool. That's what I thought. 
**[Other]** Yeah, the pathos path community chat. And dude, I feel like my day to day. I'm a startup founder. And people say that they're like, what does that mean? Right? Because there's a billion different types of startups. So I'm on the VC back train. So we've raised 35 million. We have 100 employees. I'm deeply, deeply involved, and so I have hardly any time to pursue fun shit on the side. So I put this in the fun shit category. And I also feel like it may very well be not fun shit, but necessary shit. 
**[You]** Yes. 
**[Other]** And so I've been seeing a lot of whisperings on Twitter about Claude code and how it's changing fucking everything. And I'm like, I am 100% going to be left behind. So I want to meet with someone who's an expert at it and ideally, I'd love to see just how you're thinking about it and maybe what your setup is and what you're using it for. But there's one thing in my life that I think it's, like, perfectly suited for, which is this newsletter, which maybe I posted in the onboarding form that you had. But that might take me, like, two, three hours every month. And I'm like, dude, if I could get that on autopilot, where it's like, 15 minutes, That'd be divine. And it's like. It feels like a good use case for it. 
**[You]** Yes. Total. Ing. 
**[Other]** Anyway. There we go. 
**[You]** Cool. I mean, I love that you have, like, a specific use case. Because some people have done these calls and they're like, I don't know. And I'm like, I don't know either. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** Because it is. Sometimes it can be a little bit. I mean, it's fun just for fun's sake, but it's also like, it can become like, you know, a solution without a problem, where it's like, you know, and I. And I get that way. It's kind of what's made. Me a little bit more of, like, an expert is like, I'm just, like, obsessed with it in a weird way, but it's nice when you can actually solve problems with it. 
**[Other]** Yes. Yes. Yes. 
**[You]** So I can show you around, like, what I do and stuff. But tell me a little bit first about the newsletter thing, because let's start there. Just, like, what do you. What's the flow? 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** How do you. I. How do you do it now? How would you ideally want to do it? 
**[Other]** So I publish a newsletter once a month on LinkedIn. 
**[You]** Okay? 
**[Other]** And it's a compilation of cool shit I find in my industry. So that's water. 
**[You]** Cool. 
**[Other]** So cool articles I find in the water industry, and I kind of do, like, a mini deep dive on one of them. And then I have a section about personal updates from my own life. And then I have a meme or two that I create as part of it, and it's all done manually. Like, I have zero automation. 
**[You]** Okay? 
**[Other]** Whatsoever. 
**[You]** Okay? 
**[Other]** Yeah. Is that enough context? 
**[You]** Yeah. Do you currently. Save stuff as you go throughout the month and then pull up from. From like, a. A saved place. Or you just kind of like, well, it's time to do the newsletter. Let me, like, do the newsletter. 
**[Other]** That's it. I have a reminder on my calendar, like, time to write the newsletter. And then I spend, you know, a couple hours and knock it out. That's basically it. If I find, like, a cool article or someone sends me one, I'll just dump it into, like, a. Like an email draft. 
**[You]** Okay? 
**[Other]** But apart from that. Literally nothing. 
**[You]** Do you? How. How on the spectrum of, like, I want to write the whole thing myself. To. I'm okay with AI doing a lot of the writing. Where do you fall? 
**[Other]** Very cool with AI doing a lot of the writing. Yeah. 
**[You]** Okay, cool. 
**[Other]** Y. Eah. 
**[You]** Okay? Sweet. And then the last question. How far have you gotten with, like, playing around with it yourself? Zero, okay? 
**[Other]** I use Chat GPT regularly. I've played around in Gemini and with Nana Banana and like, I've enjoyed that too. 
**[You]** Okay? 
**[Other]** But I have not used Claude. I think I signed up for Anthropic like two years ago or something, but beyond that. 
**[You]** Do you have, like, a pro account or no? Okay? 
**[Other]** No. 
**[You]** So to use cloud code, you do have to have a pro account. 
**[Other]** Cool, all right. 
**[You]** But what we can do is I can show you, like, how I would do it. 
**[Other]** Yeah, perfect. 
**[You]** Yeah, let's just start there, and then we can kind of branch out into a lot of other ways that I use it, but. 
**[Other]** Okay? Great. 
**[You]** We can just kind of start there. 
**[Other]** Sounds awesome. 
**[You]** Okay? 
**[Other]** Oh, it is being recorded. Perfect. All right, sweet. 
**[You]** Is it? I don't think so. 
**[Other]** I think so. Oh, that just means it's live, I guess. Never mind. Not recorded. 
**[You]** Yeah. And let me. We. We definitely can. 
**[Other]** All right. 
**[You]** I'm happy to. I'm going to jump to a different browser, so I'll be right back. 
**[Other]** Okay, sounds good. 
**[You]** And then I'll hit record. 
**[Other]** Sweet. 
**[You]** Yo. 
**[Other]** Yo. 
**[You]** Okay? Manage record. Ing. Start recording. Start. Now we're recording. And then let me share my screen. Are you on a Mac? Or windows. Windows, okay? 
**[Other]** Windows. 
**[You]** That shouldn't really matter. Okay? Because Windows, it's all mostly the same. 
**[Other]** Got it. 
**[You]** Okay? So I use the terminal. I think it's just called the terminal. In windows. 
**[Other]** The terminal. I'm going to put you up on the bigger monitor so I can see better. All right, cool. 
**[You]** Okay? So I will say, like, how. How familiar or how down are you with the terminal? And, like, kind of getting a little haggery. Like, would you. Are you cool? 
**[Other]** Yeah. I mean. If it. If I'm expected to actually write code, I'm hosed. 
**[You]** No, no, nothing close to that, but more like. Because there's sort of a couple. There's like this, which is where I'm at right now, the terminal. And then Claude itself now has what it calls cowork mode, which is available to people on the pro plan. 
**[Other]** Okay. All right. 
**[You]** I don't know it as well, but we can. We can try both and kind of see how it works. I'll start with. 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** Just like in the terminal because it's much more. What I know they launched this co work thing, like, two days ago because of all the hype and stuff around it. It's essentially the same thing. But I mean, the big thing to kind of understand is like, it's all on your local machine. 
**[Other]** Sw. Eet. Gotcha. 
**[You]** Is the big difference between this and like, using ChatGPT normally is like everything is yours. 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** Which means, you know, that it's not like going out to some random. Like, you own it. You know, you own the process. You own. So, like, the way that I would kind of think about doing this is I would be like, okay. 
**[Other]** Four. 
**[You]** Like. What do we. And I would probably just. So I. I just type in Claude and that would start. Is it big enough? Can you see the text and stuff? 
**[Other]** Yeah, yeah, we're good. 
**[You]** Okay, cool. So I would literally just ask Claude what to do. So I'd be like, okay, I want to create a workflow for automating my. Own. It's about water. I Write it on LinkedIn. And then it has this thing called planning mode that, like, I would probably say planning mode. 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** When it's in questions and we can figure out how to do this. And then. So what I would do, because I've had some experience with this and what. What we can kind of build for you that I can then send you is like. It's called a skill, and a skill is like, something that you can run. That would be like, you know, like newsletter or whatever. I have a bunch of them. Like, you know, like a random one. ITW Social is like, that's a client of mine who I do social media for. So when I, when I run that skill, it pulls up a bunch of files that it, like, reviews and then it has instructions for what to do. So we're going to essentially make one of those for you. 
**[Other]** Interesting. 
**[You]** That is like, basically like a kind of an instruction manual. And context file for what you're going to do. 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** Such that anytime you want to run it. It already knows, like, everything that it needs to do. 
**[Other]** Got it. Got it. Okay. 
**[You]** And then we'll. So, yeah, so I'm kind of getting ahead of myself, but asking me some more questions to figure out how to do this, and then let's make it. Command, we're going to say to them, Anytime. So I. I like to keep things pretty broad and brief. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** Because it will ask the right questions. And probably a lot of the. The wrong ones, too. But, like, it's pretty amazing how little you have to do. 
**[Other]** Okay, sweet. 
**[You]** So let's kind of see it in action. 
**[Other]** I love that they call it seasoning. That cracks me up. 
**[You]** Yeah, so I. It's funny. I make it, I have, like, instructions for it, too. And I always make it, say, the date and the day because it fucks this up so much. 
**[Other]** Y. 
**[You]** And it drives me crazy. So, anyways, I haven't. So. Okay, so let's figure it out. Okay. So what's the newsletter called? 
**[Other]** Eah, it's called. 
**[You]** Do you want to just answer? Yeah. 
**[Other]** Dude, that's actually a great question. What the fuck do I call. Hold on. Because I have a water podcast, too. I know. I'm. I. I don't. It doesn't have a. It doesn't have a name. Actually. 
**[You]** It's just my name letter. On. 
**[Other]** Yeah, just call it, like. Oh, no, that's a lie. I totally lied. It's called At Water's Edge. Jesus. 
**[You]** Water like that. 
**[Other]** That's it. 
**[You]** Okay, how long is a typical issue? 
**[Other]** Oh, gosh. In terms of. 
**[You]** But you said you. You have, like, a format, right? Yeah, you said that already, so. Yeah, the format. Format is you. You said it's. A deep dive into something. Or. No. 
**[Other]** So they're like, I'll have. I'll take four articles, one of which I'll do a deep dive on. And then three. I'll just like, quick hitter. Like, hey, check these three out. They're really cool. And then I also have a personal update section in there. 
**[You]** Update. A couple. Names. Happy New Year. Also probably just say, like, by the way, Just me. I'm getting my computer set up. And I'll turn my camera. Okay, so how long is a typical issue? I don't even have to really answer that. Where do you currently gather sources? You? Basically, yeah. How do you do that? 
**[Other]** Normally I'll just go to chat. Or Google and be like, hey, what are the, like, four most recent water articles that you think I would find cool? 
**[You]** So that's helpful. I bet it will probably be like, okay, so it can do that for you and, like, bring up a bunch of articles for you. 
**[Other]** Nice. 
**[You]** What's the most painful part right now? 
**[Other]** Probably so. Riding the draft and formatting for LinkedIn are both a pain in the ass. 
**[You]** That's right. Right at the day week. I will. Remind. Cal. Endar. Every. Month. What would done look like for this skill? 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** Including. The doctors are we just talking about Pat? 
**[Other]** So those first four bullets for sure. 
**[You]** Ients right now. 
**[Other]** The reminder. I mean, I guess I don't know how that would. What would that mean in, like, Claude? 
**[You]** Let's come back. To that. One. I agree. I guess that would mean more of, like, if you're using it on a daily basis. And, you know, like, I, for example, like, I have, like, this thing called chief of staff that's like. I run it every day. And it basically tells me, like, here's what we have to do today. 
**[Other]** Oh, okay. All right. 
**[You]** But that's like a much kind of broader. 
**[Other]** I gotcha. 
**[You]** Infrastructure that we could eventually set up. And then feed into this and have this feed into that. But I'd say for now, we can just keep it pretty simple. 
**[Other]** Like, if. If I were to tell it, like, every. Like, do this every month. And then it just would, like, send me a notification that it completed this task. 
**[You]** I. Think we might as well do that. I mean, we could do that. I don't know how to do that. But. Let's just evaluate. Let's just say that, yeah, we'll see all of the above. 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** And be awesome. 
**[Other]** And you can say, like, do it, like, maybe like the first Thursday of every month. 
**[You]** Let's see. First, third. And. Then. A win in a month. Do you publish? 
**[Other]** Yeah. So, yeah, first week usually. 
**[You]** Let me know what the current friction is, okay? Cool. So we'll just save that for now. Y. Eah. 
**[Other]** Like at this point, to me, it feels very similar to chat or Gemini. 
**[You]** Yes. 
**[Other]** But I imagine it will change pretty soon. 
**[You]** I think. That's what we're trying to figure. Out. I think I'd like to recommend. Yes, because. I mean, you could probably do a lot of this in chat or Gemini. But I think, like, 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** I would probably rather do it in here because you would, like, own the entire structure and process. 
**[Other]** I gotcha. Okay? 
**[You]** Quick follow up water topics. 
**[Other]** Is there, like, is there a way that I can feed it past issues? 
**[You]** Exactly. Yeah, that's what I was just thinking. 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** Do you have those ready or easily? Ready or even. 
**[Other]** Yeah, like it. So I publish from all of my personal website as well, which maybe should have been another part of this instruction. That'd be really cool if it could do that. 
**[You]** Results. 
**[Other]** But, yeah, they're all, like. They're all just listed on my website. 
**[You]** The. Results need to go. Yeah, could you put the link in? 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** The evaluator. Wants all the. Activated data. For google form. S we get it to the. Practice. Of. But the. Practice is. Won't. Know. And it'll short on. So this is, like, kind of where it starts to get a little different, right? Is that, like. I would be like, Saved them as reference. And then create a voice guiding or atom. So we. Have. A. Good sense of. How. It and. What? These. News. Letters. So this is where I'd be. Like, this is where I'd really want to. Have all of this on my computer. Or, like, have all of this saved? 
**[Other]** Sure. 
**[You]** Where, like, any time. Because then, like, you know, you could. You just. That's, like really rich data. 
**[Other]** Sure. 
**[You]** For you to own and have. And that when you're like, okay. You know, look back through my past issues and see if I've talked about this before or review, you know, like, do a end of year summary. Or most importantly, Create, like, a voice guide based on me and how I write. We want to have all of this. And like, then you also will save that voice guide. And then every time we run that skill. You start that skill it will have it will reference and have access to. All of that stuff. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** Like that feels a little different. Like you could pull all of that into Gemini or GPT every time. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** But, like, even that, I'm, like, it doesn't always work that great. Whereas this is like. Whereas this is like, it's like, it's just. It's trained. 
**[Other]** Yeah, you're right. It doesn't. It doesn't. Well, it's like an executable file, like, which you would think is similar to what chat. Like. So, like, in chat, you can commit things to memory. 
**[You]** Exactly. Exactly. 
**[Other]** Which I don't understand why it's not the same, but it doesn't sound like it is, you know? 
**[You]** Yeah, but. Exactly. And I think. I think part of why it isn't the same is, like, you don't. We don't really know how it works, right? It's, like, over there in their system. It kind of decides how it uses it, when it use it. This is like, it's a file. It's really simple. It's on your computer. It knows to use it. It won't use anything else. It's never making a decision about what to use and what not to. 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** You know, it's like. It's very limited. In scope. And very like clear instruction. 
**[Other]** Got it. Got it. Very cool. 
**[You]** Yeah. So you can see it's kind of working now. I. I have this like, apify thing, which is like an add on, but I think it would have been able to do it without that, actually. But right now it's like it's saving all of these, so we'll have all of these. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** And I'll. And I'll. I'll. I'll share all of this with you. So. So you have all of this as well. 
**[Other]** Sw. Eet. I love, I love how it's thinking like it, you know, it like. One of my concerns was that there are blogs interspersed that are not water related, that are just I'm interested in or like I did for SEO purposes. And up above it was like I see about 20 articles, some of which are just generic SEO bullshit. And some of which are water. So we're just going to look at the water ones like that's. 
**[You]** I. Thought we'd just do those at the end. 
**[Other]** That's cool as shit. 
**[You]** Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's amazing. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Yeah. That's super awesome. I love it. 
**[You]** But, like. But that's, you know, that's a great sort of thing, too, where you could, like, expand and be like. You know what? Actually, I do want. Like 10 new SEO ones. Write those and publish them every five days to the website. 
**[Other]** Right. 
**[You]** You know, like, where is this website hosted? I'm just curious. 
**[Other]** Right? Yeah. Yeah. Squarespace. 
**[You]** Okay, cool. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** Yeah. So we could, like. There's a lot we could do there, too, of just like, you know, getting. These. I wonder, does squarespace. What? Would it be? Yeah. So another thing is, like, are you familiar with APIs in general? 
**[Other]** Oh, yeah. Yep. 
**[You]** Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. So, like, I would probably, if we were doing something, you know, like a next step, I would be like, if you wanted to publish directly to Squarespace, I'd be like, also build in a connection to the Squarespace API so that when we publish, when we create a draft for LinkedIn and it's approved. It also automatically pushes to squarespace. You know, and then that would just be done. Too. 
**[Other]** That's dope. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** How much am I? How much am I costing you right now? I see the tokens. 
**[You]** Oh, nothing, nothing. So I'm on. I can show you. The Max plan, so it's 100 bucks a month. 
**[Other]** Okay, 100 bucks a month, that's it. 
**[You]** Yeah, exactly. 
**[Other]** Wow. 
**[You]** And I'm like, so it resets at 4am so I'm not even going to be able to use up all of my stuff for the week. 
**[Other]** Gotcha. Okay? Cool. 
**[You]** Sometimes I do use it all and then I have extra usage. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** But, yeah, every. There's, like, a big joke in a quad code community that, like, it's the biggest subsidy of all time, that they're, like, giving the shit away, basically. 
**[Other]** Yeah. For sure. 
**[You]** Yeah. Because, like, I'm. You know, it's like, coders must use this, and they use a ton more than me. So I'm like. But I did. I did keep hitting the max on the 20 slam. So I needed to upgrade. But here, while it's still going. Okay, so now it's saving. Everything is marked down. And so let me just show you too, like. 
**[Other]** Got. It. 
**[You]** Show and finder just so you can see. Like. Like this is just a folder. For? I put you in the client. It did that, by the way. Like, I didn't do that. That's another massive thing. 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** Is like HQ clean is like, this is my folder structure and I suck at managing folders and files and all of it. And, like, it just kind of does all that for me. Like, if I have a new client, it automatically creates a new client folder for me. And even though, like, some of this, there's duplications Obviously, it's like. But then you have a folder and it made a newsletter reference, and now each of these is just a markdown file. 
**[Other]** W. Ow. 
**[You]** Do you use markdown at all, or have you. 
**[Other]** No. 
**[You]** It's really simple. 
**[Other]** No, I mean. Yeah. Squarespace makes it easy. I don't have to use Markdown. I have in the past, but not anymore. 
**[You]** Yeah. I bet you could, like, copy markdown into squarespace and it would work. But, like, this is essentially markdown. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Why did? I'm curious. Why you? Why? You said to create a markdown file. 
**[You]** Where? It's just like sort of the known universally easy file format. For. For claude code to use, because it's like. Like a text file. Like a. Txt file is like plain text you can't format, whereas this is like. 
**[Other]** Gotcha. 
**[You]** If I preview this? It will look really good. 
**[Other]** Yeah, nice. 
**[You]** And that I can. You know, I can take this. I can put it into Google like a new Google Doc. If I just did and then do paste. For markdown. I know. It's in a new Google Doc, perfectly so it's like it's infinitely transferable. While also being just plain text. 
**[Other]** Yep. 
**[You]** Meaning that a code reader can use it. 
**[Other]** Cool. Okay. 
**[You]** Yeah. Travels. Okay, so it's still going. Astronauts. Dr. P. Incredible. Something else. Oh, yeah. I mean, I can just show you. Like, this is sort of what my chief of staff thing looks like. So when I run that. So you can see, like, it. It. It has current files that it reads. 
**[Other]** I got you. Yeah. 
**[You]** And these are like, sort of the important things that I've asked it to always look at. Including, like, a don't forget file, which is like, here's certain files, here's like. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** I don't know why there's actually items to surface, but I have, like. I should look at the instructions, because there's certain instructions that are like, hey, don't forget that Alex is like that. I'm, like, really bad at certain things. So please don't let me make those mistakes again. And. 
**[Other]** Gotcha. That's wild. 
**[You]** The way of thinking about it that I think is important and will be helpful for you is like I update the instructions as I'm doing things. In your case. Or actually, let me. Let me do one where if I do like itw Social, which is like the social generator, which is a little bit more related to what you're doing somewhat, it's like, I'll have it. So it's like Connor is the CEO that I do this for, and let me read the lessons learned. 
**[Other]** Nice. 
**[You]** So what do you have for me? So what if I was like, I just randomly, like, post on Dream and a, you know, and it'll, like, come up with some posts. 
**[Other]** In his voice. 
**[You]** Yeah, exactly. But, like, voice is one of the hardest things, you know? 
**[Other]** For sure. For sure. 
**[You]** And so what often I'll do is I'll be like, okay, like, I'll tinker with it. Okay, let's just pretend like it worked. Like, we would go back and forth with it, and then I'd be like, update your instructions with the less rooms learned. During this combo. Right. So, like, that way, it's getting better as we go. 
**[Other]** And so you're not telling it to update a certain markdown file. You're just saying generally. And it knows what? Which of those. 
**[You]** Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like, I'm. I keep things pretty abstract in that way where I'm, like, I'm letting it kind of make the decisions about, like. 
**[Other]** Interesting, okay. 
**[You]** What? Where things go and. And then correcting a lot. Rather than because once I get into the organizational layer, And I'm, like, trying to change the names of things, or it's like my brain just starts to, like, shut down. And also I don't. It doesn't help because I'm not as good as this machine and organization of file, you know, like, so I. I try to kind of keep my brain on like the idea level. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Right. 
**[You]** Okay, cool. So it's made of voice guide. Let's look at it. 
**[Other]** Yeah. I mean that they nailed it. The overview nailed it for sure. Yeah. 
**[You]** Sig time is conversational. Like a smart friend who happens to be obsessed with water. That's great. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Yeah, yeah. 
**[You]** That's like a good so conversation. Examples. Right. This is great. 
**[Other]** It's perfect. Yes. 
**[You]** Awesome. You know, cool. And then basically, like, if something was really, like. Because it. It obviously won't work. A lot of the time. And then you'll be like, hey, please, like, never do this. Or. You know, I don't like this, and here's why. 
**[Other]** Gotcha. 
**[You]** And whatever. 
**[Other]** And you just open up a new terminal when you do that, or do you have to, like, reference this past one to. 
**[You]** What do you mean? 
**[Other]** Like, so let's say I. Let's say I. So, like, we shut all this down, I open it back up. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** And the first thing I would do is say, okay, run the newsletter. Skill. Is that right? 
**[You]** Yes, yes. 
**[Other]** Okay? And then, yeah. 
**[You]** And it. It will know to read this and to read anything else that we want it to look at. 
**[Other]** Okay? Okay, gotcha. All right. And so then let's say it. I don't know. I'm sure we'll get to this point, but, like, okay, let's actually execute this. And do it like, let's create a newsletter draft. 
**[You]** Yeah. Yeah. 
**[Other]** And then if I don't like it. Then in the terminal, then. 
**[You]** You. Too. 
**[Other]** That's when I would update it. So, like, every time I want to. I guess the question I'm asking is if I want to revise the newsletter skill. Then I have to first run the skill and then give it the feedback. 
**[You]** Well, you don't have to be inside of the skill to update it. You can be anywhere in Claude, but you probably would be somewhere inside of it. 
**[Other]** Okay, okay. Okay? Okay? 
**[You]** If you were giving it feedback, but it doesn't matter because it's all just like a file. 
**[Other]** Gotcha. 
**[You]** But, yeah, I think I see your question. I think if we keep going. 
**[Other]** Okay? Cool. 
**[You]** Okay, so he's got what I learned. Still need answers. Personal update. Do you write this yourself, or do you want the skill to prompt you for bullets? I know. It's just something I. 
**[Other]** I write it myself. Yeah, I read it myself. 
**[You]** Do you want to write it yourself, or do you want to just give it, like, some bullet points? 
**[Other]** I'll probably continue writing it myself. I just don't know how it would access that information. Like trying to think where it could pull from, where it would be relevant. 
**[You]** Well. I. I mean, I think you would still have to give it some information, but basically, like, you could, like, record a voice note and just like, give it that or just give it some bullet points of like, I want to talk about X, Y, or Z, or you, you know. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** Or you could. I think we could just make it broad and be like, ask him for. The personal update section and either right give you. Guidance on what to write. 
**[Other]** Cool. Yeah. 
**[You]** It can be vague enough memes Adam makes these should the skill just leave insert meme here. Do you want it to suggest new topics? 
**[Other]** Definitely suggest for sure. 
**[You]** Cool. So, like, this is a. This is one more. Like, I would probably nerd out for a while and try to make the memes for you, but, like, that's. That's. That's a place where it actually might be way more worth than is smart to do. But. But for now, yeah, suggest delivery. Where does the finished draft go? 
**[Other]** Perfect, right? Yeah. Okay, cool. 
**[You]** Right now, we just want it as we probably want it. Just because you're going to post it to LinkedIn. 
**[Other]** Yeah. So, I mean, if it's in markdown, in a Google Doc, that's totally. That'd be perfect right now. I drafted in LinkedIn. 
**[You]** Yeah. Can. You pass. Notification. How does Adam know the draft is ready? To do that automatically once a month. Counted by. Drive automation. See above. 10. 
**[Other]** I don't think LinkedIn has that API. Let's see. I'm really curious. 
**[You]** Well, not non API. But more just like, I could just check too, but, like, if I copy this into a LinkedIn post, will it read the markdown? My hunch. My hunch is now. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Maybe, though. In the newsletter. It would. 
**[You]** Because that's like a different format. 
**[Other]** Exactly. Yeah. 
**[You]** A right article like that. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Read article. And then. 
**[You]** I did handle. 
**[Other]** I don't know if you hit net or. 
**[You]** It did work when I did it like that. So that's markdown, right? 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** But not when I pasted it. But it did also handle the. Like the bold. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** It read that. So it's. It's kind of a mix. 
**[Other]** Interesting. Okay? Okay? Well, maybe if you hit that. The markdown button up top in the style bar. Did that work on the far right? That's a markdown button, right? 
**[You]** Which one? 
**[Other]** That one. Oh, that's embedded link. That's an embed. Just kidding. All right. 
**[You]** Yeah. Yeah. Code. You can do code. But that's different. Let's see what it said to. LinkedIn newsletter supports rich text editor is what you see is what you get. But the workflow is simple. Clean Markdown. Adam paced into LinkedIn. Most formatting carries over or use markdown to LinkedIn.com. Insane that that's a website. 
**[Other]** That is crazy. Yeah. Wow. Dude, no way. 
**[You]** Wow. 
**[Other]** That is. That's ridiculous. 
**[You]** Yeah, cool. I mean. That's so weird. 
**[Other]** Can Claude use that instead of me? 
**[You]** Maybe. Yeah. I mean, but the thing is, it might then not be able to taste it. There's also another layer of this, which is like Clime can control Chrome. So it could then eventually probably paste it. But it's like, that's. That's the kind of thing where it's like, marginal returns pretty quickly. 
**[Other]** Okay? Y. Eah, totally right. Exactly. Yeah, the last mile. Problem? 
**[You]** Which is like, a trap for me where, like, I. I'll be. I'll, like, spend two days on something that literally takes six seconds, but I'm just like. I don't want to, you know. 
**[Other]** Y. Eah. So funny, okay. 
**[You]** Okay? So notifications. We could set up a simply monthly reminder or a cron job that pings at em. Let's skip that. Yeah. So here's the spec. Adam runs water in his letter skill searches for four articles. I think I would right away be like, for two. Let's actually search for, like, 10 or 15 articles so he can pick. 
**[Other]** Yep. 
**[You]** And make sure the articles you are looking for are related in five to what usually. Writes about skill. I think you probably want to pick the deep dive and roundup, right? 
**[Other]** Yep. Yep. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** Good call. 
**[You]** And pick which ones he wants for. Yes. Floor, five drives. And then I think we want. A chance. Edit. To give notes. 
**[Other]** Smart. Yeah, that kind of is. Like you're pro, you know, you're a pro user. 
**[You]** Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like, that's just stuff I've learned of, like. I've run into issues that are often solved or, like, you know, you're kind of building for the longer term. This way. Where? Like, who knows? You know? It's like I have all of my I have a newsletter called both are true, and it's like I have all of my both are True stuff. 
**[Other]** Got it. 
**[You]** In a folder that it can access. 
**[Other]** Got it. 
**[You]** Just. Because then I can be like, what do I usually write about? Or like, why am I such a piece of shit? Or whatever, you know, like. Like, just, like, have it. Have it kind of look banned through everything, and it's fun. You know? 
**[Other]** That's amazing. 
**[You]** And then to. 
**[Other]** How long have you been working with this. 
**[You]** Probably like a year, maybe a little longer. 
**[Other]** Okay? Okay. All right. And now, having used it for that long, do you feel like this is going to change everything? Are you, like, it's always going to be kind of imperfect and, like, you're going to need human in the loop and, you know, 
**[You]** I mean. I think that's more of, like, a philosophical question, you know, because, like. Like, like in your instance, right? Like, I bet it could. Eventually write something that did sound like you. And was you, more or less. But, like, I don't know if you would want that. Right. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** Maybe. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** But, like, for me, like, I just recently published this thing. Not to my substack, which is to my blog, which is something that I automate largely with Claude, but it's like. It's this. Like, I got to write my own stuff. And it's like, because, like, I need to be involved. You know other. Otherwise, what the fuck is the point? 
**[Other]** Sure. 
**[You]** I think it's like. But I do really like it for automating, you know, like this, like, my chief of staff stuff was like, good morning. This stuff is so hard for me. So emotionally, like, draining and hard. And this does help. It doesn't take it away fully, but I do feel a lot lighter than I used to. 
**[Other]** Gotcha. Gotcha. 
**[You]** You know, And I think that really matters. For me. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Yeah. 
**[You]** And, like, I really like this idea of, like, I have, like, don't forget, and I have an inbox. That like. So if I'm doing anything else with Clon. So I. I have. This is a bit intense, but where is. It's called Agent Deck and. So it's like I have all of these sessions on the left here. And each of these is like its own conversation with Claude that had, like, organized clients, life play experiments, coaches. Like I've created a coach for myself. I have, like, so it's a lot of. But, like, it's how my brain works, you know, and. But if I'm, like, you know, in a random thing, Doing, you know, like some marketing for. This is for a client, too, called Brit. But I could be like, a add this to my chief. Staff inbox so I don't forget. And then that will get. Next time I run chief of staff, it'll be there. You know. Okay, cool. So this is ready? Fully built and registered. 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** Knowledge. Cool. So this is just like, literally a folder? That this is what I'll share with you. 
**[Other]** Yep. 
**[You]** And you'll then, you know, ask Claude to, like, install it as a skill. Which it will know how to do. But it's got your voice guide, it's got these essays, it's got the skill folder, which has all of the details, the instructions. So I'd say, yeah, let's do it. Let's just give it a whirl. 
**[Other]** Yep. Here we go. 
**[You]** Let me search for reset. 
**[Other]** Nice. I see how it's thinking about this, okay? So I already see something we're going to want to change. Right. It's heavily focused on, like, atmospheric water harvesting. Like, I don't give a about that specifically. Right. Like, it just so happened that there was an interesting article about it. But it's thinking that, like, that's something that I should be including every month. Let's see what it comes up with. But, yeah. 
**[You]** Yeah. Yeah, it maybe went a little too specific. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** But that's where the guidance is going to be really helpful. And so this already makes me think, like, what we should do and what I'd probably like open a new cloud session for. 
**[Other]** For sure. 
**[You]** And start working as I'd be like, let's update the water. Nose, letters, skill. Can share links he finds interesting at any time. And there's an inbox. Where you can see that. When we run this again, it checks. The invoice. And uses. Any of this. 
**[Other]** Nice. Yeah, that makes sense. 
**[You]** Articles. So? So that way you're, like, a lot more involved if you want to be, right? So then you could just be like, hey, client, add this to my inbox. Cool. So let's see. Let's see how good it did. 
**[Other]** Yeah. It's also looking at recent. That's interesting. Yeah, they don't have to be recent either. They could be. I mean, they could be old. Like, really doesn't matter. It's interesting. 
**[You]** Cool. 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** Yeah, we'll have to be some. I mean, this is the beauty of it, though, is that you iterate. 
**[You]** Exactly. 
**[Other]** And make it better, right? 
**[You]** Exactly. And I think you do have to have, like, a kind of a tinkerer mindset here. 
**[Other]** For sure. For sure. 
**[You]** Okay, cool. So. Any of these feel good or. 
**[Other]** Yeah. I mean, subsea detail is pretty dope. 
**[You]** Which one? 
**[Other]** The first one. 
**[You]** Okay? 
**[Other]** Number four looks pretty cool. Pre dope 4 is cool. Let's look at some other ones here. Five. Yeah, we've already done water, battery stuff. You can keep scrolling. Massive Roman water basin. Seven could be cool. 11. That's cool. Yeah. Perfect. 
**[You]** Any one of them you. You feel like could be the deep dive. 
**[Other]** Maybe. Probably the blob one, I'm guessing, which I think was four, I'm not sure. Yeah. Yeah. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** Y. 
**[You]** And, like, obviously, you know, I don't know what your process is, but you could then be like, you know, for the Blob one, like, go find five other articles written about it and, like, include the personal update. I mean, I can just kind of make this up. 
**[Other]** Eah. 
**[You]** Unless you got something. 
**[Other]** For personal. You can just make whatever. Up. Yeah. Dude. Yeah, I'll for sure include you in this. And then give me the link. Book your shit if you want people to keep paying you. I'll put it in there. 
**[You]** Oh, I didn't. Please. Please. That would be awesome. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** Love. It met a moment. So it's going. It's going deep on salty blob. And that when. While it does that I'll like, I'll. I can just give it a like and as an FYI or search in generally. More articles. Some updates. I don't want them to be super recent. What was the other one? 
**[Other]** I mean, you could even, like. 
**[You]** It was like. 
**[Other]** I mean, I'm even, like, definitely, like, go wider. Don't maybe, like. 
**[You]** Go a lot wider. Topics, don't. 
**[Other]** Doesn't have to be about topics we previously covered. Yeah. 
**[You]** Need to match what we've already covered. 
**[Other]** Yeah. And honestly, like, even historical stuff would be fascinating for my audience. So, like, you can go as far back as you want, like. Shit published in the 1800s would be just as interesting. You know what I mean? 
**[You]** So then, like, what is the litmus test? It's like, the litmus test is really just. Would this make a reader go, whoa, what the hell? You know, or like, whatever that. 
**[Other]** Exactly. Exactly. 
**[You]** Okay, cool. So now we've got this. Draft. 
**[Other]** This is pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. This is perfect. This is great. 
**[You]** Nice. And I mean, what I'll often do with. With stuff like this is I'll take it out of here and just, like, edit it, and then I will give it. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** The final draft, so it kind of knows. Like, here's what we did different, and then I'll make an update. 
**[Other]** Gotcha. Okay? And you put the final draft in as just text, or do you upload, like, a file? 
**[You]** Yeah. No, I just. Either way. But it doesn't matter. One one of the big. 
**[Other]** Okay? Okay? 
**[You]** Things with us is, like, you don't have to format anything. Like, it could be the biggest, like, glob of bullshit, and it will. It will know how to kind of handle it. 
**[Other]** Got. It. Okay, nice. Cool. 
**[You]** On this draft. Let's say good to go. 
**[Other]** Yeah, Mine is the meme. Unless that's next. That was step four, I guess, right? Or whatever it was. Oh, yeah, there we go. 
**[You]** Oh, yeah. It says insert meme here. Yeah, let's see. Suggesting meme concepts. 
**[Other]** Okay? Perfect. Just like a computer following the instructions. 
**[You]** Is this a pigeon meme? Guy labeled the ocean. 
**[Other]** That's it. 
**[You]** Point at a massive blob. Is this something I can hold? 
**[Other]** Number two is pretty good, actually. Yeah, they don't know Party Meme. Oh, yeah, Number three would be good, too. That's actually awesome. 
**[You]** And that's another, like, little thing, but, like, if it's working like this, you can just, like, add something new. 
**[Other]** That's helpful. That's helpful. That pisses me off about that, Yeah. 
**[You]** You don't have to. You don't have to wait. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** And you can also stop it with escape, which I do sometimes, where I'm like, okay, this is. We've gone way too far. Cool. So it's right here. And then I can copy that. Go to. Just the dot. There you go. 
**[Other]** Dude, that's insane. That's so awesome. That's so dope. 
**[You]** Nice. And then. And then the last thing I just say about this is, like, you know, like, this is sort of phase one, right? It's like, do the thing for me that I need done. And then phase two is like, well, what else could we do? You know? Like what? Okay, awesome. Let's brainstorm. What else do we. Are. 
**[Other]** How does it do with. Yeah, how does it do with newsletter creation or, like, even something as simple as, like, add the images for the roundup articles. Right now I'm going to have to go back to the website, clip the image, put it in. 
**[You]** Online. Yes. So images, I mean, with markdown, images are just, like, referenced. So they have to, like, live somewhere on your hard drive. But that would be a good question to be like. Also, I would love. So actually, let's just remove this brainstorm thing. But, like, that's something you can ask, too. Just like, you know, you can. Like, one thing I could. You would do maybe is be like, here are, like, my broader goals with the newsletter and my, like, you know, my brand and the company's brand. And, like, what could I do? What could we do? You know, so kind of, like, not because this was like, I have a thing I need to do. Help me do it. But this. But, but, but. Another layer zoomed out is more like, here's my broad goals and, like, needs. How do I get there? 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** And, like, research how other people have gotten there, you know, I do. I haven't do a lot of that. Of, like, what are other people doing? Let's do that. Or, like, some version of that. But, like, in my voice. 
**[Other]** Yeah. And. Yeah, and same with meme creation. Like, now I'm going to have to go to a meme maker and do that whole thing. 
**[You]** And creation. You create. The memes. Or. That was. Me maker, right? 
**[Other]** Yeah, like, I'll just go to. 
**[You]** Or it's image. It's generator. 
**[Other]** There it is. Yeah, there's a bunch. I just kind of, like, go to whatever pops up. Yeah. Yeah, that's perfect. 
**[You]** I know that they have an API because I've used it. I had a big thing that I wanted to do a while ago where I, like, basically generated memes automatically based on, like, some. Based on an essay. 
**[Other]** Oh, nice. 
**[You]** That I wrote because I thought that could be a cool business. Meme creation. Here's the disaster you'd label it cool. I can't create, but I can potentially use browser automation to fill it up on image form. So it could do that. I also think it actually could create it. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Okay? 
**[You]** I feel like you could create via their API and then images pull images reciting and give you the direct links. Just image search terms generate images. Looking for images. Just saving them to this aim folder as the newsletter would be great. So, like, pushing back too, right, is like, it. It. It's like I can't create it. It's like, no, you actually can, so you can't always trust it. 
**[Other]** Yeah, exactly. Sure. 
**[You]** But it's like I. That. That just comes with knowledge too, of, like. I just know that it can do that. It might not be great, but I know I can do it. 
**[Other]** Yeah, let's see what happens. I mean, even so, like, it's already saved me, you know, at least an hour or two worth of work. So if I have to go and create a few memes, it's not a big deal. Plus to your article that you wrote. Like, the meme creation is kind of the fun. Like, it's like, oh, I'm creating. Oh, shit. Maybe I want to go this angle or this angle or, you know, do whatever. 
**[You]** Totaling. So I feel like I actually have an API. Oh, I have to be on premium. 
**[Other]** Yeah, don't sweat it. 
**[You]** Son of. A pitch. 
**[Other]** It's all good. 
**[You]** Okay? Cool. I know, I know. We only have a couple. A few more minutes right now. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** So did we do it? Did we do something cool? 
**[Other]** Absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure, for sure. I Now I'm worried about my. My night. I'm gonna be up to, like, 1aM Just digging around with this thing. 
**[You]** Awesome. 
**[Other]** It'll be fun. 
**[You]** Hell, yeah. Man. I'm going to send you all of the actual assets. 
**[Other]** Co. 
**[You]** And then also like, some instructions on how to get it started. 
**[Other]** Ol? Okay, perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, this was sick. I really appreciate it, man. 
**[You]** Awesome. Yeah. Yeah, this was cool. I felt like I was just hanging with a friend. 
**[Other]** I appreciate it. Appreciate you. Yeah. Lending some wisdom, dude. Super, super cool shit. Anything I can do to help you. 
**[You]** Happy. I mean. Yeah, maybe just. I don't know. Yeah, it might take you up on just sharing this with. With people. 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** And to have it a little more like I'm about to put up a website. I just launched, like, a cohort. It sold out of, like, you know, 500 bucks for five weeks of this. For just five people, but I'm going to do another one. So just. Yeah. Help spreading the word. 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** That would be awesome. That'd be amazing. 
**[Other]** Sweet. Yeah. Give me your link that I can drop into this newsletter and I'll do it. No doubt. 
**[You]** Awesome. Awesome, man. Thank you so much. 
**[Other]** Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. Appreciate you, dude. 
**[You]** Of course. Happy to do it. It's fun. 
**[Other]** All. Right. Good luck with the storm. Hopefully it's uneventful. 
**[You]** You, too. All right. Later, adam. 
**[Other]** All right, See you, dude. 
**[You]** Back.
