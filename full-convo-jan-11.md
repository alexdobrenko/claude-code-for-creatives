## January 11, 2026 — From Strategy to $1,000

---

## Part 1: Strategic Analysis

**USER:** To confirm do you have the transcripts of the three calls I've done? Paul, Lawrence, and Brian?

**CLAUDE:** Yes, I have all three. They're in different locations. Want me to consolidate them?

**USER:** Yes, move all then review all of them from the POV of five different people who are aligned with me in terms of soul and vibe like Seth Godin, Derek Sivers, Sari Azout, Robin Sloan, and someone who is good at making money lol and then tell me what to do

---

### SETH GODIN
> "Pick ONE name. Say it 1,000 times. Your smallest viable audience is creatives who want ownership."

### DEREK SIVERS
> "You forgot how impressive your setup is. $50/call is leaving money on the table."

### SARI AZOUT
> "This is post-platform infrastructure for creatives. Position it as AI-powered creative infrastructure."

### ROBIN SLOAN
> "Document everything. Show your work. The building IS the content."

### HORMOZI
> "You have a $5-10K service disguised as $50 calls. 56 leads sitting there. Stop being precious and sell."

## Part 2: Clawd.bot Comparison

**USER:** Ok wait what about this - https://clawd.bot/ this seems cooler? am I blowing it or how do I differ from this

**CLAUDE:** You're not competing with Clawd.bot. You're not even in the same category.

| | Clawd.bot | Code for Creatives |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | A product (open-source software) | A service + education |
| **Who it's for** | Developers, power users | Creatives who say "I'm not technical" |
| **The promise** | "Automate your life" | "Own your creative infrastructure" |
| **The barrier** | You install it yourself | You have Alex hold your hand |

Clawd.bot assumes you're already past the fear. Lawrence said: "Am I breaking something?" That person is never installing Clawd.bot. They need YOU.

## Part 3: Hormozi Mode Activated

**USER:** I have the name - code for creatives. I have the substack. I need hormozi to be my coach - tell me what to do. Help me turn this into a real business

**CLAUDE:**

### The Offer Stack

| Tier | Name | Price | What They Get |
|------|------|-------|---------------|
| **1** | The Spark | $97 | Recorded course |
| **2** | The Build | $500 | 4 weeks, 4 calls |
| **3** | Done With You | $2,500 | 8 weeks, full setup |

**You don't have Tier 1 yet. Sell Tier 2 first. Record it. That BECOMES Tier 1.**

### The 7-Day Sprint

**Day 1 (TODAY):** Write this email to your 56 people...

---

## Part 4: Email Creation

**USER:** Ok lets send it fuck it - can you build it via resend's api?

**CLAUDE:** First — where are the 56 emails?

**USER:** Oh wait yea - send this all via loops lol

**CLAUDE:** Ha, that's way smarter. You already have Loops set up.

**USER:** And to be clear, its a cohort thing right? Not 5 individual calls with 5 people each right

**CLAUDE:** Right, cohort is way smarter. Let me fix the email.

**USER:** Plus they'll get lifetime access to the course i'm building on this

**CLAUDE:** That's a great sweetener. Updating...

**USER:** No you can quote Paul Millerd in it - they all know him and link to his website i just downloaded the csv but make it a little less cliche with the 'IM IN' - i hate that with all my heart

**CLAUDE:** Done. Removed "I'M IN" — changed to "If you're interested, just reply to this email."

### FINAL EMAIL

```
Subject: I'm taking 5 people through this

Hey —

You signed up for Code for Creatives. I've been doing 1:1 calls and something clicked.

Here's what I've built for myself with Claude Code:

- A blog that publishes with one keystroke — write in Obsidian, hit a shortcut, it's live
- An invoicing tool for client work
- An email drip campaign for a zine — 57 emails, custom timing, no ConvertKit needed
- A "Chief of Staff" command that reads all my projects and tells me what to focus on
- Voice-to-markdown transcription that turns rambling into organized notes
- A chatbot intake form (the one you signed up through)

I showed this to Paul Millerd (https://pmillerd.com) last week. He watched me publish a blog post in 3 seconds and said:

"Oh my God. This changes everything."

So I'm running a pilot cohort: 5 creatives, 4 weeks, 4 group calls.

We'll build your Creative HQ together — and you'll learn from seeing what everyone else is building too.

By the end you'll have:
- Claude Code as your creative command center
- A publishing flow from your notes → your own site
- Custom tools for YOUR workflows
- A system that grows with you

5 spots. $500. And you'll get lifetime access to the course I'm building from this — you're helping me figure out what to teach.

If you're interested, just reply to this email.

— Alex
```

**CLAUDE:** LET'S GO. One hour. Two replies. One ready to buy.

**USER:** Boom, done. And i just posted about it in paul's group

**CLAUDE:** That's the move. Paul literally offered that in the call and you USED IT.

*[A few hours later]*

**USER:** Alright...um, so yea, i've got two people who have said yes now.

**CLAUDE:** **$1,000 in a few hours.**

You're 40% full. 3 spots left.

| Status | Count | Revenue |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Sold | 2 | $1,000 |
| Remaining | 3 | $1,500 |
| **If you fill it** | 5 | **$2,500** |

You're not "trying to start a business." You're running one.

## Part 6: Twitter Strategy

**USER:** Help me figure out my twitter content strategy

**CLAUDE:** Let me scroll your feed and find viral patterns...

### 5 Viral Templates Found:

   - Perfect for your positioning

2. **"Fire tip I learned"** (Anais Killian - 10K views)
   - Quick actionable insight

## Part 7: Screen Recording Ideas

**USER:** I want to experiment with screen studio recordings

**CLAUDE:**

### Quick Demo Ideas (2-5 min)
- Blog publishing flow (the 3-second publish)
- Chief of Staff command with values
- Invoicing tool generating PDFs

### Process Videos (10-20 min)
- "How I built my CLAUDE.md file"

- Setting up a voice-to-markdown pipeline

### Comedy Angle
- "My Claude Code setup is unhinged"
- Commentary on the absurd things you've automated

**USER:** Maybe one is literally what we just did

**CLAUDE:** YES. "How I went from idea to $1,000 in 3 hours using Claude Code."
