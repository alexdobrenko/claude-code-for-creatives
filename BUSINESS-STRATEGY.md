# Code for Creatives — Comprehensive Business Strategy

**Last Updated:** January 23, 2026
**Status:** Cohort 1 sold (5 buyers at $500), Cohort 2 planning

---

## Executive Summary

Code for Creatives is a cohort-based program teaching creative professionals (writers, designers, podcasters, freelancers) to build their own tools with Claude Code. It's positioned as "AI for Creators Who Want to Stay Human" — emphasizing ownership, infrastructure-building, and personal tool-making over generic productivity hacks.

**The opportunity:** Claude Code is an "alien tool with no manual" (Karpathy). Everyone feels behind. The market gap is massive — tutorials show WHAT AI can do, not HOW to actually use it in your specific work.

**What's working:** $2,500 revenue from 5 buyers without a landing page. Paul Millerd partnership. Rich curriculum content. Real case studies. Clear differentiation.

**The model:** Cohorts validate → Self-paced course scales → Community sustains.

## Part 1: What's Working Already

### Revenue Proof
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cohort 1 Buyers | 5 |
| Price Point | $500 |
| Total Revenue | $2,500 |
| Sales Method | Direct outreach, no landing page |

**Buyers:** Antoine Mestrallet, Nikita Petrov, Meghna Mann, Alex Chung, Chris D'Antonio

### Distribution Lined Up
| Channel | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Paul Millerd (Pathless Path) | Active | Offered to create "Claude for Creatives" channel, send people Alex's way |
| Maliha | Warm | Email list cross-promo potential |
| Lex | Warm | Email list + community (creative professionals) |
| Sari | Warm | Sublime network — ideal creative audience |

**Paul's quote:** "Don't be ashamed to sell this to people. Our kind of writing doesn't help people make money. This can help people directly make money."

### Positioning That Resonates
Based on 6 discovery calls, this positioning works:

> "The gap between the easy version and the powerful version never closes. It just moves. If you're willing to get your hands a little dirty, there's always more."

**What hits:**
- **Ownership** — "You're in control. It's a lot less of a black box." (Lawrence Yeo)
- **Identity shift** — Not productivity, not automation — becoming someone who builds
- **Courage framing** — "You can't fuck up that bad."
- **Simplicity** — "Just ask Claude" as the core mantra

### Assets Ready to Deploy

```
RESISTANCE ←————————————————————————————————→ POWER USER

Chris          Brian        Lawrence      Adam         Paul         Sterling
(allergic)     (blocked)    (curious)     (focused)    (validating) (advanced)
```

### Persona Details

**1. Adam Tank — "Time-Strapped Founder with Specific Need"**
- Startup CEO, 100 employees, no time for side projects

## Part 3: Strategic Positioning

### The Enemy
Surface-level AI tutorials that explain what tools do but not how to actually use them in your specific work.

### The Belief
AI is most valuable when integrated into YOUR existing workflows, not when it replaces everything you do.

### The Core Message

**Not:**
- A generic AI course
- Claude Code tutorials
- An automation tool
- "10x your productivity"

**Is:**
- Teaching creatives to build their own infrastructure
- Cohort-based, learn together
- Ownership over your creative systems
- The guide for people who outgrow the easy version

### Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Their Angle | Our Difference |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Takeoff** ($25/mo) | Broad AI skills, subscription | Narrow focus (creatives), cohort + community, one-time payment |
| **Nat Eliason** (~$500) | AI-assisted coding, self-paced | Creative focus, live cohort, build YOUR infrastructure |
| **Cowork** (Claude Max) | GUI, consumer-friendly | Terminal power, full system access, you own everything |
| **Generic tutorials** | What AI can do | How to use it in YOUR work |

**The winning angle:**
> "Cowork is where you start. The terminal is where it gets fun."

## Part 4: Revenue Model

### Current State
- **Cohort 1:** 5 buyers × $500 = $2,500
- **Cohort cadence:** TBD (aiming for few times per year)

### The Funnel

```
AWARENESS           CONSIDERATION           DECISION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
BAT Newsletter  →   Newsletter Signup  →   Cohort Waitlist
Blog posts          (curious)              (ready to buy)
Twitter                    ↓                      ↓
Paul's community    Free content           $500 cohort
                    Case studies
```

### Pricing Evolution (Paul's Advice)
1. **Calls** ($100-200 each) — Where you are now
2. **Workshop** (half-day, $200-500) — Next step
3. **Cohort** ($500 current, could go higher) — Validated
4. **Self-paced** ($300-500) — After cohort content is refined

### Revenue Scenarios

| Scenario | Cohorts/Year | Buyers/Cohort | Price | Annual |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------|--------|
| Conservative | 3 | 10 | $500 | $15,000 |
| Moderate | 4 | 15 | $500 | $30,000 |
| Optimistic | 4 | 20 | $750 | $60,000 |
| + Self-paced | — | 100/year | $300 | +$30,000 |

### The Long Game
This could be sustainable income for 15+ years without consuming Alex's life:
- Cohorts a few times per year (not constant hustle)
- Self-paced course runs in background
- Community sustains between cohorts
- Content compounds on botharetrue.com

## Part 6: Marketing Strategy

### The Two Properties

| Property | Purpose | Content Type |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| botharetrue.com | Trust building, SEO, top of funnel | "I built this with Claude" posts, philosophy |
| codeforcreatves.com | Conversion, bottom of funnel | Landing page only, focused on cohort signup |

### Content Strategy

**Blog posts that work (from brainstorm doc):**
- "Yes, But First" format — respect search intent, deliver insight first
- "The Journey Doc" — document process even when you don't ship
- Case studies — Adam Tank newsletter is the killer example

**SEO angles (search intent):**
- "What's the best terminal for vibe coding"
- "Cursor vs Windsurf vs Claude Code"
- "How to use Claude Code for non-coders"

### Launch Sequence for Cohort 2

**Week 1: Foundation**
- [ ] Ship landing page (requirements in REQUIREMENTS.md)
- [ ] Wire newsletter signup to Loops
- [ ] Wire waitlist to Loops (separate audience)

**Week 2: Content**
- [ ] Publish Adam Tank case study on BAT blog
- [ ] Post to r/ClaudeAI with "real projects" format
- [ ] Reach out to Paul for community post

- [ ] Paul shares in Pathless Path community
- [ ] DM warm contacts (Maliha, Lex, Sari)

**Week 4: Close**

- Adam Tank: "That's insane. That's so awesome. That's so dope."
- Lawrence Yeo: "You're in control. It's a lot less of a black box."
- Sterling: "This is the moment I've been waiting for my whole fucking life."

## Part 7: Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Terminal Anxiety Kills Conversion
**Evidence:** Chris James literally said his brain turns off when he sees terminal stuff.
**Mitigation:**
- Lead with "you don't need to code" messaging
- Show GUI-adjacent tools (Agent Deck, Obsidian)
- Address fear directly in curriculum
- Consider Cowork → Claude Code progression path

### Risk 2: Tools Change Too Fast
**Evidence:** "Why am I learning this if GUI is coming?" (Chris)
**Mitigation:**
- Position as "skills transfer" — principles over tools
- Tool-agnostic framing in all content
- Update curriculum as tools evolve
- The ownership angle is tool-agnostic

### Risk 3: Can't Scale Without Burning Out
**Evidence:** This needs to work without consuming Alex's life
**Mitigation:**
- Cohorts are time-boxed (4 weeks)
- Self-paced course runs in background after validation
- Community sustains between cohorts
- Record everything for reuse

### Risk 4: Market Gets Crowded
**Evidence:** Nat Eliason, Takeoff, others entering space
**Mitigation:**
- Creative focus is the moat
- Both Are True brand is differentiation
- Community + relationship > content alone
- Build while others teach (Social HQ, Chief of Staff, etc.)

## Part 9: The North Star

### What Success Looks Like

**In 1 year:**
- 4 cohorts completed (~60 students)
- $25,000+ revenue
- Self-paced course launched
- Community of builders who help each other

**In 3 years:**
- Recognized as THE program for creative tool-building
- Sustainable income (~$50-100k/year) without constant hustle
- Students building tools that impress even Alex
- Both Are True brand amplified, not diluted

### The Deeper Stakes (From PROJECT.md)

> "This could be sustainable income for 15+ years. Needs to work without consuming Alex's life. The weird Both Are True creative energy is the differentiator — don't sanitize for 'AI education market.'"

### The Rallying Cry

> "Everyone can do everything now. So what matters? Courage. Taste. The willingness to keep going until it works. That's what we teach."
