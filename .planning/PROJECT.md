# Code for Creatives — Home

## What This Is

A landing page and front door for Code for Creatives — a cohort-based program teaching creatives (writers, designers, podcasters, freelancers) to build their own tools with Claude Code. The page captures interest via newsletter and cohort waitlist, showcases what's possible through a use cases gallery, and positions against alternatives like Cowork.

## Core Value

Capture the current AI wave with a working front door — newsletter signups and cohort waitlist wired to Loops, deployed and live. Every day without this is missed opportunity.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Landing page with clear value prop ("Build your own tools with AI")
- [ ] Newsletter signup — ongoing content relationship
- [ ] Waitlist for Cohort 2 — specific interest in the program
- [ ] Use cases gallery — showcasing what you can build with Claude Code
  - Personal examples: invoicing tool, blog publishing, chief of staff, photo renaming
  - External inspiration: Drift (message in a bottle), dharm.is (Reddit recs), Verdant Biodome
- [ ] FAQ section with competitive positioning
  - Cowork vs Claude Code ("Cowork is training wheels, Claude Code is the bike")
  - Tool-agnostic framing (skills transfer even if tools change)
  - "Do I need to code?" (No — you describe, Claude builds)
- [ ] Testimonials / social proof (Paul Millerd quote exists)
- [ ] Forms wired to Loops API
- [ ] Deployed on Netlify

### Out of Scope

- Content publishing workflow — separate project for later
- Course curriculum / lesson content — Alex handles separately
- Blog integration — not this phase
- Self-paced course platform — future consideration after cohorts validate
- Substack sync — later

## Context

**Timing matters.** WSJ published an article about Claude Code today (Jan 18, 2026). There's buzz happening. Cohort 1 starts in ~1 week with 5 buyers. The wave is now.

**Existing assets:**
- Design foundation: `v7-colorful.html` — solid starting point with hero, what you'll build, testimonial, about, CTA, FAQ
- Content goldmine: `.planning/research/ai-course-brainstorm.md` — extensive use cases, external examples, fundamentals series
- Positioning: `competitive-research.md` — Cowork, Takeoff, Nat Eliason comps
- Blog post ready: `blog-post-vomit-pipeline.md` — publishing workflow writeup
- Email system: Loops API already configured
- Hosting: Netlify already set up

**The deeper stakes:**
- This could be sustainable income for 15+ years
- Needs to work without consuming Alex's life (cohorts a few times/year, not constant hustle)
- The weird Both Are True creative energy is the differentiator — don't sanitize for "AI education market"

**Positioning:**
- "AI for Creators Who Want to Stay Human"
- "The gap between the easy version and the powerful version never closes. It just moves."
- Not generic AI tutorials — this is about building YOUR infrastructure

## Constraints

- **Time**: Ship ASAP — momentum is happening now
- **Tech stack**: Loops for email, Netlify for hosting (both already configured)
- **Voice**: Must maintain weird creative energy — this is what makes it different from every other AI course

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Both newsletter AND waitlist | Different intent levels — curious vs ready | — Pending |
| Use cases gallery as key feature | Shows what's possible, not just what you'll learn | — Pending |
| FAQ includes Cowork positioning | Addresses "why not just use the easy version" | — Pending |
| Tool-agnostic framing | Skills transfer even when tools change | — Pending |
