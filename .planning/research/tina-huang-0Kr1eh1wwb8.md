## Key AI Topics & Tools Covered

### Fundamental Concepts
- **Artificial Intelligence** - Computer programs that complete cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence
- **Machine Learning** - Programs that analyze data to make decisions or predictions
- **Generative AI** - AI that generates new content (text, images, media)
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** - Process and output text (example: Gemini)

### Practical Examples Used
- Google Maps (navigation AI)
- YouTube recommendations
- Ripe vs unripe apple classifier (machine learning training example)
- Gemini chatbot interactions

### Key Concepts Emphasized
- **Data Quality is Critical** - "The quality of data that you're providing the program will determine how good it is"
- **Human in the Loop** - Google advocates for keeping humans in decision-making process
- **Knowledge Cutoff** - AI trained at specific point in time, doesn't know events after that
- **Hallucinations** - AI outputting false information (example: "rabbits are brainstorming the White House")
- **Iterative Prompting** - Don't need perfect prompt first try, refine through iterations

## Frameworks & Mental Models

### 1. Human in the Loop Approach
**Bad approach:** Ask AI for a slogan → use it blindly
**Good approach:** Ask AI for slogan suggestions → tweak → provide more details → YOU make final decision

**High stakes example:** Never blindly trust AI to diagnose medical issues

### 2. Critical Evaluation Questions
When evaluating AI output, ask:
- Is the output accurate?
- Is the output unbiased?
- Does the output include sufficient information?
- Is the output relevant to my project or task?
- Is the output consistent if I use the same prompt multiple times?

### 3. Prompting Techniques

#### Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Prompting
- **Zero-shot** = Ask without examples (simple tasks)
- **One-shot** = Give one example
- **Few-shot** = Give multiple examples (better for nuanced tasks)

**Key insight:** "Large language models are really good at pattern recognition" - show examples rather than over-explaining

#### Chain of Thought Prompting
Break complex tasks into subtasks with step-by-step reasoning.

**Example use case:** Creating purchasing codes for 1,000 employees
1. Provide context (rules for code creation)
2. Give worked example showing step-by-step logic
3. Ask for new case
4. Automate for remaining cases

"This is a task that would be pretty tedious to do if you don't know how to code but now you can do it very very easily"

### 4. Prompt Engineering Best Practices

**Clear, Specific Prompts with Context:**
- Basic: "Recommend restaurants in San Francisco"
- Better: "Recommend Japanese restaurants in San Francisco with a cozy, laid-back environment"

**Consider the Verb:**
- "List" = bulleted list
- "Create a table" = structured data with columns
- "Summarize" = condensed key points
- "Classify" = categorize (positive/negative/neutral)
- "Extract" = pull specific information
- "Translate" = maintain tone and structure
- "Edit" = adjust for audience

**Always think about desired output format** and be as specific as possible

**Pro tip for preventing hallucinations:** Ask AI to include sources

## Language & Communication Style

### How Tina Explains AI to Her Audience

**Conversational & Relatable:**
- "Let's be honest if I didn't do this you're probably not going to review it yourself so I'm doing it for your own good"
- "Pretend to be your friend when you're lonely and don't have anyone to talk to"
- "Kids don't believe everything AI tells you"
- "It's honestly not that bad it might be a little embarrassing but..."

**Uses Everyday Examples:**
- Restaurant recommendations
- Email writing
- Company slogans
- Growing plants in a garden program
- Creating purchasing codes

**Practical & Efficiency-Focused:**
- "Just saved you an hour there"
- "This course is honestly pretty fluffy"
- Includes assessment at end because "research shows that immediately reviewing information is the best way to retain that information"
- Her personal pro tip: After getting good result, ask AI to write a single prompt that would have gotten that result directly

**Educational Psychology:**
- Adds interactive assessment
- Acknowledges retention research
- "I guarantee that you have increased the retention of that information significantly"

**Meta Commentary:**
- Honest about course quality: "module 5 is like nice and stuff but it honestly doesn't have that much useful information"
- Notes what's "fluffy" vs valuable
- Highlights what she thinks is best: "my favorite module in this course"

## What Seems to Resonate

### Emphasized Content

1. **Prompt Engineering Module** - She explicitly calls it out as the best section, her favorite
2. **Iterative Approach** - Stressed multiple times that prompting is iterative, not one-shot
3. **Human in the Loop** - Repeated emphasis on human final decision-making
4. **Chain of Thought** - Spent significant time on this "intermediate" technique
5. **Responsible AI** - Dedicated section on harms, biases, quality of service issues

### Practical Value
- Real automation examples (purchasing codes for 1,000 employees)
- Time-saving emphasis (8 hours → 15 minutes)
- Concrete use cases over theory
- "Tasks that would be pretty tedious to do if you don't know how to code"

## Gaps & Opportunities for an AI Course

### What's Missing

1. **No Hands-On Practice**
   - Tina summarizes but doesn't make viewers actually DO the prompting
   - Opportunity: Interactive exercises, live demos, practice sessions

2. **Limited Tool Diversity**
   - Focus almost entirely on Gemini
   - Opportunity: Compare multiple tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.), show which for what

3. **No Advanced Automation**
   - Chain of Thought example shows potential but doesn't teach implementation
   - Opportunity: Actual coding integration, API usage, workflow automation

4. **Business/Creative Applications Underexplored**
   - Generic examples (slogans, emails)
   - Opportunity: Domain-specific deep dives (content creation, business operations, creative work)

5. **No Personal System/Workflow**
   - Tips and tricks but no cohesive system
   - Opportunity: Complete workflow frameworks, personal AI stack setup

6. **Limited on "Why This Matters"**
   - Focuses on "how" more than "why" or "when"
   - Opportunity: Decision frameworks for when to use AI vs not

7. **Missing Mindset/Psychology**
   - Technical focus, less on mental barriers
   - Opportunity: Overcoming AI resistance, building confidence, courage to experiment

### Content That Worked Well

- **Clear definitions** with relatable examples
- **Framework-based teaching** (human in the loop, evaluation questions)
- **Progressive complexity** (zero-shot → few-shot → chain of thought)
- **Specific verb vocabulary** for prompting
- **Honest quality assessment** of the source material

### Tina's Unique Value Props

1. **Efficiency positioning** - "Save you 8 hours"
2. **Former Meta data scientist** credibility
3. **Straight talk** - calls out fluff, highlights best parts
4. **Learning science** - uses retention research to structure content
5. **Filtering role** - "I did this so you don't have to"

## Course Design Insights

### What an AI Course Could Learn

1. **Start with clear structure/modules** upfront (Google's 5-module approach works)
2. **Build from fundamentals → practical → advanced** (definitions → use cases → techniques)
3. **Include hands-on assessment** (Tina added quiz, could go further with exercises)
4. **Be honest about what's valuable vs fluff** (builds trust)
5. **Use everyday language** and relatable examples
6. **Teach evaluation frameworks** not just prompting techniques
7. **Address responsibility/safety early** (not afterthought)

### Opportunities for Differentiation

1. **Go deeper on automation** - Show real implementation, not just concepts
2. **Build complete workflows** - End-to-end systems, not isolated tips
3. **Domain-specific applications** - Content creators, entrepreneurs, specific niches
4. **Mindset + technical** - Combine courage/psychology with skills
5. **Tool comparison frameworks** - When to use what, not just "here's Gemini"
6. **Community/accountability** - Tina's is one-way consumption
7. **Personal examples** - Your actual use cases (invoicing, blog publishing, etc.)

### Positioning Opportunities

- "AI for people who want to BUILD, not just chat"
- "From AI tourist to AI operator"
- "AI as your organizational layer" (your concept)
- "What matters most in the age of AI is [courage/taste/judgment/etc.]"

## Bottom Line

**What Google/Tina did well:** Clear frameworks, progressive complexity, honest curation, practical examples

**What's missing:** Actual implementation, hands-on practice, complete workflows, domain-specific depth, mindset/courage work, tool diversity

**Your opportunity:** Bridge the gap between "here are prompting tips" and "here's how to transform your work with AI" - with real examples, complete systems, and the courage/mindset piece that technical courses skip.

The market has plenty of "AI essentials" courses. The gap is "AI transformation for [specific audience]" with real workflows, implementation, and psychological safety to experiment.
