## Frameworks & Mental Models Presented

### 1. The New Lean Startup (AI-Era Framework)

**Traditional Lean Startup (outdated):** Build → Measure → Learn
**New AI-Powered Lean Startup:**

1. **Find ideas based on data** - Use AI to scrape real conversations (Reddit, Facebook groups)
2. **Validate before building** - Spend 3 hours researching with multiple AI tools
3. **Pen & paper synthesis** - Write down insights manually before coding
4. **Build landing page first** - Not the full product
5. **Iterate based on real feedback** - Accept your first idea won't be the winner

**Key Quote:** "Measure twice, cut once" - Don't be "trigger happy to vibe code"

### 2. The ACP Funnel (Greg's Business Framework)

- **A = Audience** - Build attention first
- **C = Community** - Convert audience to engaged community
- **P = Product** - Build and sell to existing community

**Application for AI video:** Create high-quality AI videos → Build faceless/branded accounts → Monetize to audience

### 3. The 80/20 AI Collaboration Rule

**Core Principle:** AI does 80% of the work, you do the critical 20%

- AI generates the bulk content/strategy/code
- You refine, add beliefs, inject expertise
- **Critical:** "You can't just accept it as 100% perfect - you need to read this and agree with it"
- The extra time lets you make the final 20% "much more impactful"

### 4. Multi-LLM Research Strategy (3-Hour Deep Dive)

**Process:**
1. Start with ChatGPT prompt
2. Copy/paste same prompt into Claude
3. Run through Gemini
4. Try Perplexity
5. **Critical step:** Use notebook & pen to synthesize insights manually
6. Spend "like a day doing that" before any coding

**Why it works:** Each LLM has different strengths; synthesis creates unique insights

### 5. Context is Everything (Prompting Framework)

**Problem:** People don't give AI enough context, then blame the tool
**Solution:** IdeaBrowser approach - funnel all relevant data into each prompt section

**Quote:** "The issue that people have when they vibe code... they don't get the result they want. So they're upset... 'Oh, this is useless.' But what's great about this is it gives the right amount of context."

### 6. The ChatGPT App Opportunity Framework

**Goal:** Build SDK-native apps that ChatGPT automatically surfaces for high-intent queries

**Strategy:**
- Own a "high-value keyword" (like SEO for AI era)
- Example: "Help me get a mortgage" → Your app appears first
- Solve specific requests ChatGPT can't handle natively
- Create custom visual UIs (like Zillow example)

**Comparison:** Similar to early SEO or App Store - first movers win big

### 7. Customer Language Mining

**Method:**
- Find Reddit/Facebook pain points
- Copy exact user quotes
- Paste into ChatGPT/Claude with prompt: "Make landing page copy that speaks to these user quotes"

**Why it works:** Eliminates jargon, speaks in customer's actual language
**Stat cited:** Average web conversion = 1-2%, but using customer language can increase 4-12x

### 8. Digital Twin of Your Customer

**Concept:** Create an AI agent trained on:
- Internal data (Gong calls, customer research)
- External data (Reddit, forums, reviews)
- Use it to edit/review all marketing before publishing
- Ensures you speak in customer language, not marketing jargon

### 9. AI Video Framework (PJ Ace Method)

**Process:**
1. Write scroll-stopping script with ChatGPT/Claude
2. Script elements: Juxtaposition, humor, highly visual, recognizable characters
3. Create storyboard frames in Figma
4. Generate consistent character images (using Freepick)
5. Choose right model for each shot (different strengths)
6. Generate video clips
7. Edit together

**Key insight:** Start with scriptwriting framework, not the tools

## Language & Communication Style

### How Greg Explains AI to His Audience

1. **Non-technical, outcome-focused**
   - Doesn't dive into model architecture or technical details
   - Focuses on "what can you build" not "how does it work"
   - Example: "Vibe coding" instead of "using Claude Code with context windows"

2. **Analogy-heavy**
   - "Light bulb business" (helping people have insights)
   - "Training wheels for anyone to prompt"
   - Cemetery business is "grim" (humor to humanize)
   - Website as "static library" vs. chat as dynamic

3. **Pragmatic skepticism**
   - Acknowledges limitations: "They start to lose track of the code"
   - Honest about failures: "Custom GPTs... was a massive failure"
   - Warns about loss of control: "You don't control the experience, OpenAI does"

4. **Framework over features**
   - Presents repeatable systems (ACP funnel, multi-LLM research)
   - Values process over individual tool mastery
   - "This is the framework for how the new line of businesses are being created"

5. **Real examples, not hypotheticals**
   - Shows actual tool (IdeaBrowser)
   - References PJ Ace's 300M views
   - Cemetery example, chicken coops, Instagram origin story
   - Brett's squirrel TikTok (7M views)

6. **"No permission needed" ethos**
   - "I don't ask for permission"
   - "You can go do any of these right away"
   - Democratizing access: "You don't need to be Sam Altman"

7. **Strategic contrarianism**
   - Cemetery business better than ChatGPT apps (hot take)
   - Ideas DO matter (against Silicon Valley conventional wisdom)
   - Old web is "antiquated"

### Phrases That Resonate

- "Creative juices flowing"
- "I won't hold back" / "I'll give away all the magic"

- "Slow down, my friend"
- "The messy middle"
- "It is what it is" (about OpenAI control)
- "This is where the world is going"
- "AI gold rush" + "attention gold rush"

### What He Emphasizes (Based on Repetition/Energy)

1. **Don't skip validation** - Repeated 4-5 times
2. **Context in prompting** - Mentioned as THE critical factor
3. **Your first idea won't win** - Instagram/Bourbon story
4. **Pen and paper synthesis** - Mentioned multiple times, clearly important to him
5. **Use multiple LLMs** - "I don't know why more people don't do this"
6. **Customer language** - Conversion rates, quotes from Reddit
7. **Build audience first** - ACP funnel mentioned multiple times

## Target Audience Insights

Based on who Greg is speaking to:

1. **Entrepreneurs, not developers** - "Non-technical person" mentioned explicitly
2. **Impatient builders** - "Fingers burning to vibe code"
3. **Skeptical but curious** - Wants honest take on limitations
4. **Outcome-focused** - Million dollars is the goal, not learning for sake of learning
5. **Time-constrained** - "3 hours" of research feels achievable
6. **Looking for unfair advantages** - Gold rush mentality
7. **Willing to be early** - ChatGPT apps, AI video, etc.

### What They DON'T Want

- Dense technical explanations
- Theory without practice
- Tools without frameworks
- Hype without honest limitations
- "Just use this prompt" (they want to understand why)

---

## Competitive Positioning Opportunities

### What Makes This Approach Different

1. **Framework-first, not tool-first** - Most AI courses are "Learn ChatGPT" or "Master Cursor"
2. **Business outcomes, not AI mastery** - The goal is $1M, not becoming an AI expert
3. **Multi-tool orchestration** - Not married to one platform
4. **Honest about limitations** - Editing is painful, first idea won't work, etc.
5. **Real portfolio approach** - Greg runs a holding company, builds multiple products

### How an AI Course Could Stand Out

**Positioning:** "The AI Business Builder's Playbook" (not "AI Course")

**Promise:** "Build and validate 3 AI business ideas in 30 days using frameworks from someone who's built multiple million-dollar companies"

**Differentiation:**
- No coding required (but path provided if you want to learn)
- Validation before building (anti-vibe-coding bias)
- Portfolio approach (expect 2 ideas to fail)
- Real tools + frameworks (not just one or the other)
- Customer language obsession (most courses ignore this)

**Unique Mechanisms:**
- Multi-LLM research sprints
- Digital twin customer avatar
- Pen & paper synthesis protocol
- The "last 20%" refinement system
- ACP funnel methodology

## Quotable Teaching Moments

### On Ideas
> "People say ideas mean nothing, but it's just not true. Now more than ever, if you find the right niche idea based on a trend in a world where you can vibe code anything, I believe that there's life trajectory opportunity there."

### On Prompting
> "The issue that people have... they don't get the result they want. So they're upset... 'Oh, this is useless.' But what's great about this is it gives the right amount of context."

### On Validation
> "We've all been so trigger happy to vibe code but you need to understand what you're building before you're building or else you're not going to make a million dollars."

### On AI's Role
> "AI is going to do 80% and you do the last 20%, but you have so much time to make that last 20% much more impactful."

### On Customer Language
> "I don't know why more people don't [copy user quotes and use them in landing pages]."

### On Iteration
> "Your first idea is never the million-dollar business. Never. You know, there's a good chance, if you're lucky, it's your second idea."

### On Pen & Paper
> "I use a notebook... I don't know why but it just clicks in my brain more when I write things down."

### On Web Conversion
> "The average conversion rate on the internet is 1 to 2%... We're like, 'Oh yeah, that's normal.' But I think that opportunity is disappearing."

## Course Curriculum Lessons from This Video

### What Greg Does Well (Steal This)

1. **Gives away the magic** - "I consider myself in the light bulb business"
2. **Shows his actual tools** - Screen shares IdeaBrowser, Freepick
3. **Provides frameworks with names** - ACP funnel, easier to remember
4. **Uses humor** - "Most grim idea," "fingers burning to vibe code"
5. **Acknowledges alternative views** - "I hate to agree with you" when pushed back
6. **Cites specific stats** - 800M ChatGPT users, 1-2% conversion, 300M views
7. **Tells stories** - Instagram/Bourbon, PJ Ace, Brett's squirrels
8. **Demos live** - "Let's do it live" with Freepick

### What Could Be Stronger (Opportunities)

1. **More step-by-step** - Shows end result but skips middle steps
2. **Template access** - Mentions prompts but doesn't show full ones
3. **Failure examples** - What ideas did Greg try that didn't work?
4. **Time estimates** - How long does each stage actually take?
5. **Cost breakdown** - What does this cost to execute?
6. **Deeper on "the 20%"** - Still somewhat mysterious what makes good editing
7. **Follow-up examples** - What happened to people who used IdeaBrowser?

---

## Final Analysis: Course Design Recommendations

### Core Insight
Greg's approach is fundamentally about **de-risking AI entrepreneurship** through:
1. Data-driven idea selection
2. Validation before building
3. Framework-guided execution
4. Honest expectation-setting

An AI course should follow this same philosophy: **Reduce risk of wasted time, increase odds of building something people actually want.**

### The Opportunity
Most AI courses teach tools. Greg teaches **business building with AI as the lever.** The gap is a course that:
- Treats AI as means, not end
- Teaches the "last 20%" skill explicitly
- Provides validation frameworks, not just building frameworks
- Embraces the messy reality (first idea fails, editing is painful)
- Shows multi-tool orchestration, not single-tool mastery

### Course Positioning Statement (Inspired by Greg)
> "For entrepreneurs who want to build a million-dollar business with AI, this is the framework for finding, validating, and building ideas that actually make money - taught by someone who's done it multiple times and won't hold back."

## Appendix: Tools Reference Sheet

| Category | Tools Mentioned | Greg's Take |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Idea Generation** | IdeaBrowser | His co-founded tool, scrapes Reddit/FB |
| **Research/Strategy** | ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity | Use all of them for same prompt |
| **Landing Pages** | V0, Bolt, Lovable | Pick based on "brand feel," all similar |
| **Full Apps** | Replit Agent, Claude Code, Cursor | Replit = "most autonomous," Claude/Cursor for technical users |
| **Hiring Devs** | Replit Bounties | When you get stuck |
| **Image Generation** | Freepick, Enhancor.ai | Character consistency |
| **Video Models** | Sora, Nana Banana, Kling, Cling One 2 | Different strengths, choose per shot |
| **ChatGPT Apps** | ChatGPT SDK | 800M weekly users |
| **Workflow** | Figma | Storyboarding frames |

---

**Key Takeaway for Course Design:**
Greg's magic isn't in the tools - it's in the **sequence** (validate → research → synthesize → build → iterate) and the **skepticism** (first idea fails, editing is hard, you need the last 20%). A course that teaches this mindset + frameworks + honest limitations would fill a major gap in the AI education market.
