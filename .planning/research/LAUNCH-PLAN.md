**Date:** 2026-01-01
**Goal:** Launch something in the next few days
**Positioning:** Creative coder helping people actually use AI (not just watch demos)

## Your Advisors

| Advisor | Core Philosophy |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Seth Godin** | Ship before you're ready. Smallest viable audience. Permission marketing. |
| **Robin Sloan** | Indie web. Craft over scale. Make it feel handmade. |
| **Derek Sivers** | Hell yes or no. Keep it simple. Profitable from day one. |
| **Amy Hoy** | Sales Safari — what do people already want to buy? Position against the pain. |
| **Paul Jarvis** | Company of One. Enough > more. Don't scale unnecessarily. |

## The Big Strategic Question

You're torn between three models:

### Option A: Traditional Course
Pay $X for a self-paced curriculum.

**Pros:** Clear value prop, one-time sale, proven model
**Cons:** Crowded market, requires complete curriculum, "just another course"

### Option B: Free Content + Paid Vibe Coach
All content is free (content marketing). Vibe Coach is the paid product.

**Pros:** Content spreads freely, builds audience, differentiated product
**Cons:** Vibe Coach needs to be built/defined, harder to explain

### Option C: Paid Access / Membership
Pay for access to everything (resources, updates, community).

**Pros:** Recurring revenue, simpler to start
**Cons:** Requires ongoing value, can feel like another subscription

## What Your Advisors Say

### Seth Godin on the strategic question:

> "You're overthinking this. What's the smallest thing you could ship tomorrow that would create value for ten people? Not ten thousand. Ten. Ship that. Learn from it. Then ship the next thing.
>
> The question isn't 'what's the perfect business model?' The question is 'what change are you trying to make, and for whom?'
>
> You said the gap is between 'watch Greg do it' and 'I can do it myself.' That's the change. How do you create that change for one person, this week?"

### Robin Sloan on the strategic question:

> "I'm suspicious of anything that requires a platform or a funnel. The best things I've made felt more like... putting something in a bottle and throwing it in the ocean. (Like Drift!)
>
> What if the 'course' wasn't a course at all? What if it was a collection of small, beautiful things? A blog post that's secretly a tutorial. A tool that teaches by existing. A newsletter that's actually a curriculum in disguise.
>
> The vibe coach idea interests me because it's weird. It doesn't fit neatly into 'course' or 'membership.' That's probably a good sign."

### Derek Sivers on the strategic question:

> "Three options is two too many. Pick one. Ship it. If it doesn't work, try another.
>
> Here's my filter: which one could you sell tomorrow to one person for real money? Not theoretically. Actually.
>
> The Vibe Coach sounds like it needs building. The course sounds like it needs finishing. What's already done that someone would pay for right now?
>
> Also: 'outside my network via Reddit' — why? Your network is an asset. Use it. Reddit can come later."

### Amy Hoy on the strategic question:

> "Stop. Before you decide on a model, answer this: What are people already trying to buy?
>
> Go to Reddit. Go to Twitter. What questions are people asking? What are they frustrated by? What have they already tried that didn't work?
>
> 'I want to learn AI' is too vague. But 'I tried ChatGPT and it just gives me generic bullshit' — that's a pain point. 'I watch YouTube tutorials but can't apply them to my work' — that's a pain point.
>
> Your course isn't competing with other courses. It's competing with the pain of staying stuck.
>
> The Vibe Coach could work, but only if it solves a pain people already feel. Do they? Have you asked them?"

### Paul Jarvis on the strategic question:

> "You said you want something you don't have to be involved in day-to-day. That rules out live cohorts, community management, ongoing coaching.
>
> Self-paced course: set it up once, sell forever. That's the Company of One model.
>
> But here's the thing — you don't need a complete course to start. You need ONE module that's good enough to sell. Ship that. See if anyone buys it. Then make more.
>
> The 'free content + paid thing' model works, but it's slower. You're playing a long game. Are you okay with that?"

## The Synthesis

Reading between the lines of your advisors:

1. **Ship something small, now** (Godin, Sivers, Jarvis)
2. **Make it weird/differentiated** (Sloan)
3. **Solve a pain people already feel** (Hoy)
4. **Use your network first** (Sivers) — Reddit can scale it later
5. **One module, not a full course** (Jarvis)

---

## A Proposed Path

### Phase 1: This Week — The Pilot Module

**Ship ONE module as a standalone product.**

Candidates:
- **AI Chief of Staff** — You already have the writeup. High practical value.
- **Fundamentals Nobody Teaches** — 11 micro-tips. Could be a mini-course or free lead magnet.
- **Vibe Coding for Non-Coders** — The "courage" positioning. Most differentiated.

**Price:** $29-49 for a single module
**Platform:** Gumroad (simplest, no monthly fee, instant setup)
**Audience:** Your existing list first, then Reddit

### Phase 2: Next 2 Weeks — Content Marketing

Post to Reddit with the "real projects" format you captured:
> "I built X with AI. Here's how. AMA."

Each post links back to your blog or newsletter. Build the audience outside your network.

### Phase 3: Month 2 — Expand or Pivot

Based on what sells:
- If Chief of Staff sells → build more modules
- If people want coaching → build the Vibe Coach
- If people want community → consider membership

## The Key Questions to Decide

### 1. What's the first module?

| Option | Already Done | Differentiation | Ease to Finish |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| AI Chief of Staff | 80% written | Medium (others teach productivity) | Easy |
| Fundamentals (11 tips) | Listed, not written | High (no one teaches this) | Medium |
| Vibe Coding for Non-Coders | Conceptual | Very High | Harder |

**Advisor takes:**
- Godin: "Ship the one that's closest to done."
- Sloan: "Fundamentals. It's small and useful and no one else is doing it."
- Sivers: "Chief of Staff. You use it. You can show real results."
- Hoy: "Which one addresses a pain people are already searching for?"
- Jarvis: "Chief of Staff. It's practical. People pay for practical."

### 2. Free content or paid from day one?

**Advisor takes:**
- Godin: "Free to build trust, then paid for transformation."
- Sloan: "Free. Let it spread. The right people will find you."
- Sivers: "Paid. If they won't pay $29, they won't pay $299 later."
- Hoy: "Paid. Free attracts tire-kickers. You want buyers."
- Jarvis: "Paid. Even $19 filters for serious people."

### 3. Your network or Reddit first?

**Advisor takes:**
- Godin: "Network. They already trust you. That's permission."
- Sloan: "Wherever feels right. But network is warmer."
- Sivers: "Network. Obviously. Why make it harder?"
- Hoy: "Reddit for research. Network for sales."
- Jarvis: "Network. Reddit can amplify later."

- [ ] Include the link to buy
- [ ] Ask subscribers to share if it resonates

### Day 6-7: Reddit
- [ ] Post in r/ClaudeAI, r/ChatGPT, r/SideProject
- [ ] Use the "real projects" format

### Week 2+: Iterate
- [ ] Based on feedback, decide next module
- [ ] Continue Reddit content strategy
- [ ] Build email list outside your network

## The Vibe Coach Question

This is interesting but separate. Don't bundle it with launch.

**What it could be:**
- A Claude-powered coaching bot trained on your philosophy
- A daily check-in system ("What are you stuck on?")
- A prompt library + guidance

**When to build it:**
After you've validated that people will pay for the course content. The Vibe Coach could be the upsell or the subscription layer.

**Sloan's take:** "This is the weird thing. Save it. Make it special. Don't rush it."

---

## What's Actually Blocking You?

Be honest. Is it:

1. **Not knowing what to ship first?** → Pick Chief of Staff. It's closest to done.
2. **Not having a platform?** → Gumroad. 10 minutes to set up.
3. **Not having the content finished?** → Ship what you have. Improve it live.
4. **Fear of it not being good enough?** → Godin: "Ship before you're ready."
5. **Wanting it to be perfect?** → Jarvis: "Good enough is good enough."

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read this with your advisors' voices in your head**
2. **Answer the three key questions above**
3. **Pick a launch date (I suggest: this weekend)**
4. **Tell me what you decide and I'll help execute**
