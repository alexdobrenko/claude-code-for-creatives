### The Post

> **Any real projects delivered using Claude Code?**
>
> Hey,
>
> I am looking for real projects you have delivered using Claude Code.
>
> This is for a newsletter I am writing.
>
> If you can share the project, the result and a basic overview, I am happy to provide a link to your offer (if you have one). I have over 18,000 subscribers.
>
> Let me know in the comments if you are interested to share...

## Why This Works

| Element | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Clear ask** | "Real projects you have delivered" — specific, not vague |
| **Stated purpose** | "For a newsletter" — legitimizes the request |
| **Value exchange** | "Link to your offer" — people get something back |
| **Social proof** | "18,000 subscribers" — worth their time to respond |
| **Low friction** | "Let me know in the comments" — easy first step |

## How to Adapt This

### For Course Research
> "Hey, I'm building a course on using AI for [X]. Looking for real examples of what you've built — I'll feature your project (with credit/link) in the course materials."

### For Blog Content
> "Writing a post about Claude Code workflows. If you've built something cool, share it below — I'll link to your project/profile in the article."

### For Case Studies
> "Collecting case studies for [purpose]. If you've shipped something with Claude Code, I'd love to hear about it. Happy to feature your work."

## Key Principles

1. **Be specific** — "real projects delivered" not "cool stuff"
2. **State your purpose** — newsletter, course, article (builds trust)
3. **Offer value back** — exposure, links, credit
4. **Show you're worth responding to** — subscriber count, audience size, publication
5. **Make it easy** — "comment below" not "fill out this form"
