## The Prompt

> "I asked Claude to build me an app that would delight me."

That's the whole prompt. No technical spec. No feature list. Just a feeling.

## What It Built

**Drift** — a digital message in a bottle.

- Write a message
- Cast it into the ocean
- Receive a message from another wanderer

Anonymous. Timeless. Human.

## The Experience

From the site:
> "Cast a message into the ocean and receive a bottle from another wanderer."
> "Made with care for strangers everywhere."

**Design principles:**
- Minimalist, poetic
- You give before you receive
- No accounts, no profiles, no metrics
- Just human connection

## Why This Matters

### 1. The Prompt IS the Product

This isn't "build me a messaging app with anonymous users and a message queue."

It's "delight me."

The AI had to interpret what "delight" means and translate that into features, design, copy, and experience. And it did.

### 2. This Is Where We're At (Dec 2025)

A non-developer described an emotion and got a functional, beautiful app.

The barrier to building isn't technical anymore — it's imaginative.

### 3. Proof of "Courage" as a Skill

The person who made this didn't ask "how do I build an app" or "what stack should I use."

They asked Claude to make them feel something.

That's the mindset shift. That's what the course teaches.

### 4. The Spectrum of AI-Built Projects

| Project | Approach | Complexity |
|---------|----------|------------|
| dharm.is | Technical, data-heavy, ML | High (14M comments, RoBERTa) |
| Drift | Emotional, simple, beautiful | Low (but profound) |

Both valid. Both AI-built. Both solve real problems.

## As a Prompt Example

**Category:** Emotional/experiential prompt
**Technique:** Describe the feeling, not the feature

Other prompts in this style:
- "Build me something that would make a stranger smile"
- "Create an app that captures how I feel on Sunday afternoons"
- "Make something that would make me want to come back tomorrow"

## For Marketing

This is the "before and after" for the course:

**Before:** "I don't know how to code, so I can't build apps."
**After:** "I told Claude to delight me and it built this."
