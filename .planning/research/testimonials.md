## Russ
> "I consider myself a little above average when it comes to AI, and I'd already been tinkering around with Claude Code. But talking with Alex was a real eye-opener on what I might be able to accomplish with Claude Code. I'd highly recommend spending some time with Alex to get a glimpse of what's he's doing with Claude Code and to explore what you might be able to do with it as well!"

**Key insight:** "eye-opener on what I might be able to accomplish" — it's about possibility, not productivity.

## Paul Millerd
> "This is the most excited I've been about anything in a while. You're onto something here."

**Key insight:** The values/chief-of-staff demo was the "holy shit" moment — nobody else is thinking about the human/soul layer.
