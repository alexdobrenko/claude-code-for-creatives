## Topics & Tools Covered

### 1. Basic AI Definitions
- **Artificial Intelligence** - Computer programs completing cognitive tasks associated with human intelligence
- **Generative AI** - Subset of AI that generates new content (text, images, audio, video)
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** - Models that process and output text
  - Examples: GPT family (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic)
- **Multimodal Models** - Can input/output text, images, audio, and video
  - Examples: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro

### 2. Prompting (Foundation Skill)
**Two Major Frameworks:**

**Framework 1: "Tiny Crabs Ride Enormous Iguanas" (TCREI)**
- **T**ask - What you want AI to do
- **C**ontext - Background information, images, company details, target audience
- **R**eferences - Examples to inspire AI output
- **E**valuate - Review the results
- **I**terate - Refine and improve

**Framework 2: "Ramen Saves Tragic Idiots" (RSTI)**
- **R**evisit the TCREI framework
- **S**eparate into shorter sentences (avoid word vomit)
- **T**ry different phrasing and analogous tasks
- **I**ntroduce constraints (make results more specific)

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Prompting is "the single highest return on investment skill"
- Foundational for every advanced AI skill
- Add personas ("act as an expert IG influencer")
- Specify output format
- More context = better results
- Provide visual examples when possible
- Prompting is NOT becoming obsolete - it's getting more important

### 3. AI Agents
**Definition:** Software systems that use AI to pursue goals and complete tasks autonomously on behalf of users

**Six Components (OpenAI Framework):**
1. **AI Model** - The reasoning engine
2. **Tools** - Email, web browsing, database access, etc.
3. **Knowledge & Memory** - Company databases, conversation history
4. **Audio & Speech** - Natural language interaction
5. **Guardrails** - Safety systems to prevent rogue behavior
6. **Orchestration** - Deployment, monitoring, improvement processes

**Key Concepts:**
- Multi-agent systems (networks of agents with specific roles, like a company)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) - Universal USB plug for agents to access tools/knowledge
- "For every SaaS unicorn, there will be a vertical AI agent unicorn" (YC advice)

**Tools Mentioned:**
- **No-code/Low-code:** n8n (best for general use), Gumloop (enterprise)
- **For coders:** OpenAI Agents SDK, Google ADK, Claude Code SDK

### 4. AI-Assisted Coding ("Vibe Coding")
**Origin:** Andrej Karpathy coined "vibe coding" - "fully give into the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget the code even exists"

**Framework: "Tiny Ferrets Carry Dangerous Code" (TFCDC)**
- **T**hinking - Create Product Requirements Document (PRD): target audience, core features, tech stack
- **F**rameworks - Use established tools (React, Tailwind, Three.js), ask AI for recommendations
- **C**heckpoints - Always use version control (Git/GitHub) to avoid losing progress
- **D**ebugging - Copy error messages, provide screenshots, give specific instructions
- **C**ontext - More context = better results (mockups, examples, screenshots)

**Two Modes:**
1. **Implementing Features** - Focus on context, frameworks, incremental changes
2. **Debugging** - Focus on structure, error messages, screenshots

**Tools Spectrum (Beginner → Advanced):**
- **Complete Beginners:** Lovable, v0, Bolt
- **Intermediate:** Replit (shows codebase)
- **Advanced:** Firebase Studio (dual mode: prompting + full IDE)
- **Very Advanced:** Windsurf, Cursor (local development, full IDE)
- **Most Advanced:** Claude Code (command-line tools)

**Key Principles:**
- Still valuable to understand common frameworks
- Know how files interact with each other
- Build features one at a time
- Understanding structure helps with debugging

### 5. Emerging Trends & Future (2025+)
1. **Integration into Workflows** - AI being incorporated into existing products (Google IO example)
2. **Massive Productivity Boost** - Command-line tools like Claude Code for developers
3. **AI Agents Focus** - Not going away; personalised, 24/7, lower cost experiences

**Time Perspective:** "We measure things in weeks, not months or years" - time is compressing

## Frameworks & Mental Models

### Progression Structure
- **Beginner** → **Intermediate** → **Advanced** (clear learning path)
- Little assessments throughout for retention
- Each section builds on previous (prompting → agents → coding)

### The "99% Better" Positioning
- Repeatedly emphasizes making viewers better than X% of population:
  - "Better than 99% of the population" (overall)
  - "Better than 98% at prompting" (with both frameworks)
  - "Better than 88% at prompting" (with first framework only)

### Memorable Mnemonics Strategy
Every framework has a creative, memorable phrase:
- "Tiny Crabs Ride Enormous Iguanas"
- "Ramen Saves Tragic Idiots"
- "Tiny Ferrets Carry Dangerous Code"

This is BRILLIANT for retention and shareability.

### Practical Example Methodology
- Uses relatable examples (IG posts for octopus merch, mood tracking app)
- Shows actual prompts and outputs
- Demonstrates iteration process
- Real screenshots and visual aids

---

## Language & Communication Style

### Key Phrases & Emphasis
- "Highest return on investment skill"
- "Foundational for every other advanced AI skill"
- "The more context, the better the results" (repeated principle)
- "Focus on fundamentals, not chasing every new tool"
- "You can have the fanciest models... but if you don't know how to interact with it, it's useless"

### Tone & Delivery
- Conversational and accessible
- Self-deprecating humor ("word vomit all over them")
- Relatable scenarios (friend who says "anything" for lunch)
- Confident claims backed by frameworks
- Encourages trying things ("do sign up for the waitlist")

### Audience Targeting
- Speaks to beginners but provides advanced content
- Acknowledges different skill levels (spectrum approach)
- Working professionals aged 20-40 (based on her merch example)
- People interested in building things, not just learning theory

### Teaching Techniques
- **Repetition:** Key phrases repeated multiple times
- **Chunking:** Breaks complex topics into digestible frameworks
- **Scaffolding:** Each section builds on previous knowledge
- **Assessment:** Regular knowledge checks ("put it in comments")
- **Resources:** Links to deeper dives for each topic
- **Community:** Encourages commenting answers

---

## What Resonates (Based on Emphasis)

### Heavily Emphasized Concepts
1. **Prompting is foundational** - Mentioned at least 5 times as critical skill
2. **Context is king** - "More context = better results" repeated throughout
3. **AI agents are the future** - Significant time spent, positioned as business opportunity
4. **Version control is critical** - References person who lost entire project
5. **Fundamentals over tools** - "Focus on underlying knowledge, not chasing tools"
6. **Iterative process** - Working alongside AI, not one-and-done

### What Gets Detailed Treatment
- Prompting frameworks (most detailed section)
- AI agent components (OpenAI's 6 components explained thoroughly)
- Vibe coding principles (5-step framework)
- Tool spectrum (beginner to advanced clearly mapped)

### Sponsorship Integration
- Retool sponsorship (enterprise-grade agentic platform)
