# Requirements: Code for Creatives Home

**Defined:** 2026-01-18
**Core Value:** Capture the current AI wave with a working front door — newsletter signups and cohort waitlist wired to Loops, deployed and live.

## v1 Requirements

### Page Structure

- [ ] **PAGE-01**: Hero section with clear value prop ("Build your own tools with AI")
- [ ] **PAGE-02**: What you'll build section with 4-6 example tools
- [ ] **PAGE-03**: Use cases gallery showcasing what's possible with Claude Code
- [ ] **PAGE-04**: Testimonials section (Paul Millerd + others if available)
- [ ] **PAGE-05**: About section (who you are, why you)
- [ ] **PAGE-06**: FAQ section with competitive positioning
- [ ] **PAGE-07**: CTA section for Cohort 2

### Email Capture

- [ ] **EMAIL-01**: Newsletter signup form (for curious visitors)
- [ ] **EMAIL-02**: Waitlist form for Cohort 2 (for ready-to-buy visitors)
- [ ] **EMAIL-03**: Forms connected to Loops API
- [ ] **EMAIL-04**: Separate audiences in Loops (newsletter vs waitlist)

### Content

- [ ] **CONT-01**: Use cases from personal builds (invoicing, blog publishing, chief of staff, photo renaming)
- [ ] **CONT-02**: External inspiration examples (Drift, dharm.is, Verdant Biodome, Simon Willison tools)
- [ ] **CONT-03**: FAQ answers covering: "What is Claude Code?", "Do I need to code?", "Cowork vs Claude Code", "Is this just for writers?"
- [ ] **CONT-04**: Tool-agnostic framing in messaging (skills transfer even if tools change)

### Deployment

- [ ] **DEPLOY-01**: Site deployed to Netlify
- [ ] **DEPLOY-02**: Custom domain configured

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future. Not in current roadmap.

### Analytics & Optimization
- **ANALYTICS-01**: Basic analytics (Plausible or similar)
- **ANALYTICS-02**: Conversion tracking on signups

### Content Expansion
- **CONTENT-01**: Blog integration
- **CONTENT-02**: Substack cross-posting
- **CONTENT-03**: Video testimonials

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Course platform / content hosting | Separate project — cohort content delivered differently |
| Payment processing | Cohort 1 already sold via other means |
| User accounts / login | Not needed for landing page |
| Blog publishing workflow | Separate project for later |
| Self-paced course infrastructure | Future consideration after cohorts validate |
