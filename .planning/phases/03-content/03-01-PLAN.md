  <name>Task 1: Enhance What You'll Build section with specific personal examples</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>
Update the "What you'll build" section (6 cards) with richer, more specific descriptions based on research.

Current cards to enhance:
1. **3-second blog publishing** - Keep, add: "One keyboard shortcut. Obsidian to live in 3 seconds. No CMS, no friction, just words → world."
2. **AI Chief of Staff** - Enhance with: "A command that reads your projects, tasks, and calendar — tells you what matters today. Stops the 'what should I work on?' spiral before it starts."
3. **Client invoicing** - Enhance with: "Generate PDFs, track payments, send reminders. Built exactly how YOUR business works, not some generic SaaS."
4. **Email without Mailchimp** - Enhance with: "Build sequences, own your list, send on your schedule. No $50/month tool. No platform lock-in."
5. **Photo organizer** - Enhance with: "Auto-rename by date, location, or content. Your 47,000 photos finally make sense."
6. **Meeting transcripts** - Enhance with: "Pull action items from Zoom calls, add them straight to your task list. Never lose a follow-up again."

Key messaging principle: These are YOUR tools, built YOUR way. Not generic SaaS you adapt to.

  <name>Task 2: Enhance external inspiration section with rich details</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>
Update the "What's Possible" section (6 external examples) with richer details from research.

Cards to enhance:
1. **dharm.is** - "14M+ Reddit comments analyzed to find actually-recommended products. No affiliate BS. Just what real people genuinely suggest." (Add detail: "Built in a month using Python, AWS Lambda, and fine-tuned ML models.")

2. **Drift (adrift.today)** - "Digital message in a bottle. The entire prompt? 'Build me an app that would delight me.' That's it. That's the whole spec." (Emphasize: emotional prompting, no technical spec needed)

3. **Verdant Biodome** - "AI-controlled greenhouse that autonomously grows tomatoes. Sensors read the environment, Claude makes decisions, sprinklers activate. You can watch it think in real-time."

4. **Simon's 70+ Tools** - "Browser tools for OCR, image resizing, social cards, timezone conversion. Each built in an afternoon. Volume over perfection — scratch your own itch, ship, move on."

5. **Syntopic Reading** - "Discovers thematic connections across 100 books. Your personal literary graph — unexpected links between ideas you'd never find manually."

6. **Social HQ** - "Personal content OS: raw thoughts → scheduled posts across Twitter, LinkedIn, Threads. Learns your voice so it sounds like you, not a robot."

Key messaging: These aren't coding projects. They're solutions to real problems built by people who knew what they wanted.

  <name>Task 3: Update FAQ with competitive positioning and tool-agnostic framing</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>
Update FAQ section with these specific questions and answers:

**What is Claude Code?**
"Claude Code runs in your terminal and can read and write files on your computer. ChatGPT can only chat — it's stuck in a browser window. Claude Code can actually BUILD things: create files, run scripts, deploy websites, manage your entire workflow. It's the difference between having a conversation about building something and actually building it."

**Do I need to know how to code?**
"No. You need to be comfortable typing in a terminal (we teach this). Claude writes the code. You describe what you want. The skill is knowing what you want and being able to describe it clearly — that's a creative skill, not a technical one."

**How is this different from Cursor/Windsurf?**
"Cursor and Windsurf are for developers who write code and want AI to speed them up. Code for Creatives is for people who DON'T code and want to build their own tools anyway. Different audience, different goal."

**What about Cowork? Isn't that Claude Code for non-developers?**
"Cowork is training wheels. Claude Code is the bike. Cowork gives you one folder, guardrails, a friendly GUI. Great for starting. But the gap between the easy version and the powerful version never closes — it just moves. If you want to build real infrastructure that YOU own, you need the terminal. We teach you how."

**Is this just for writers?**
"Nope. Writers, designers, podcasters, freelancers, small business owners — anyone who makes things and is tired of paying for software that doesn't quite work the way they want."

**What if the tools change? Won't this become outdated?**
"The tools will change. That's guaranteed. But the skills transfer: describing what you want clearly, iterating with AI, building systems that solve YOUR problems. Claude Code today, something else tomorrow — the mindset stays."

**What's included in the $500?**
"4 weeks of live calls, Slack access, course materials, and lifetime access to recordings. Plus: you walk away with at least one working tool you built yourself."
