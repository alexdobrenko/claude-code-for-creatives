<objective>
Add the missing Use Cases gallery section and ensure all 7 required page sections are structurally complete with placeholder content.

Purpose: Complete page structure so Phase 3 can focus purely on content population without structural changes.
Output: index.html with all 7 sections: Hero, What You'll Build, Use Cases, Testimonials, About, FAQ, CTA

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Use Cases Gallery Section</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>
Add a new section between the "What You'll Build" section (ends around line 367) and the Testimonial section (starts around line 369).

The Use Cases gallery showcases what's POSSIBLE with Claude Code - inspiring examples from the wider world, not just course tools. This is different from "What You'll Build" (course deliverables).

Structure to add:
1. A new color block section with class "color-block block-lavender"
2. Section tag: "What's Possible"
3. H2: "People are building wild things"
4. A grid of 4-6 use case cards showing external examples

Use case card structure (use existing .build-card styling or create similar .use-case-card):
- Title (project name)
- One-line description
- "Built with AI" tag or similar indicator

Placeholder use cases to include (from ai-course-brainstorm.md):
1. dharm.is - "Analyzed 14M Reddit comments to find actually-recommended products"
2. Drift (adrift.today) - "Digital message in a bottle, built from: 'make me an app that would delight me'"
3. Verdant Biodome - "AI-controlled greenhouse that autonomously grows tomatoes"
4. Simon Willison's Tools - "70+ browser tools built with AI assistance"
5. Syntopic Reading - "Discovers thematic connections across 100 books"
6. Social HQ - "Personal content OS that turns thoughts into scheduled posts"

Add CSS for the use-case cards if needed (can reuse .build-card styling).
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Open http://localhost:8000 in browser
2. Scroll down - should see "What's Possible" section between "What You'll Build" and testimonial
3. Section should display 4-6 use case cards in a grid
4. Cards should be readable with project name and description
  </verify>
  <done>Use Cases gallery section exists with 6 placeholder examples displayed in a grid layout</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify and Refine All 7 Sections</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>
Review all 7 sections are present and structurally complete. Make minor adjustments if needed:

1. **Hero (PAGE-01)**: Should have h1 "Build your own tools with AI", subhead, CTA button. EXISTING - verify present.

2. **What You'll Build (PAGE-02)**: Should show 4-6 tool examples. EXISTING with 4 - could add 2 more placeholder cards:
   - Card 05: "Photo organizer" - "Auto-rename and sort your camera roll by date, location, or content"
   - Card 06: "Meeting transcripts" - "Pull action items from Zoom calls and add them to your task list"

3. **Use Cases Gallery (PAGE-03)**: Added in Task 1. Verify it renders correctly.

4. **Testimonials (PAGE-04)**: EXISTING - Paul Millerd quote. Verify present.

5. **About (PAGE-05)**: EXISTING - About Alex section. Verify present.

6. **FAQ (PAGE-06)**: EXISTING with 4 questions. Could add 2 more placeholders:
   - "How is this different from Cursor/Windsurf/Copilot?" - "Those are for developers. This is for creators who want to build their own tools without learning to code."
   - "What's included in the $500?" - "4 weeks of live calls, Slack access, course materials, and lifetime access to recordings."

7. **CTA (PAGE-07)**: EXISTING - Cohort 2 signup. Verify the #apply anchor is correct.

Ensure section order from top to bottom:
1. Hero
2. What You'll Build (yellow block)
3. Use Cases Gallery (lavender block)
4. Testimonials (dark block)
5. About (cream/default)
6. CTA (coral block)
7. FAQ (cream/default)
8. Footer
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Run: python3 -m http.server 8000 (if not already running)
2. Visit http://localhost:8000
3. Scroll through entire page
4. Count 7 distinct content sections (plus nav and footer)
5. Verify section order matches: Hero -> Build -> Use Cases -> Testimonial -> About -> CTA -> FAQ
6. Click "Apply Now" buttons - should scroll to CTA section
  </verify>
  <done>
All 7 sections present and in correct order:
- Hero section displays value prop and CTA
- What You'll Build shows 4-6 tool examples
- Use Cases gallery shows 6 external examples
- Testimonials shows Paul Millerd quote
- About shows Alex intro
- FAQ shows 4-6 questions
- CTA section has Cohort 2 signup
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After both tasks complete:
1. All 7 required sections visible on page
2. Use Cases section (PAGE-03) is the NEW addition
3. Sections flow logically: what you build -> what's possible -> social proof -> who teaches -> FAQ -> signup
4. All anchor links work (#apply)
5. Page renders without errors in browser console
</verification>
