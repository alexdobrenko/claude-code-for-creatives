# Roadmap: Code for Creatives Home

## Overview

This roadmap transforms the existing v7-colorful.html template into a deployed landing page with working email capture. The existing template provides 80% of the page structure; the work is completing the missing sections, populating with real content, wiring Loops integration, and deploying. Five phases from foundation to launch.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundation** - Project setup and template baseline
- [ ] **Phase 2: Page Structure** - Complete all page sections
- [ ] **Phase 3: Content** - Populate with real content from research
- [ ] **Phase 4: Email Integration** - Wire forms to Loops API
- [ ] **Phase 5: Deployment** - Deploy to Netlify with custom domain
