**Pricing:** $25/mo or $299/year (all courses)
**Audience:** Broad — anyone learning AI
**Model:** Subscription, self-paced courses

**How we differ:**

### Nat Eliason's "How to Code with AI"
**What:** Course on AI-assisted coding
**Pricing:** ~$500
**Platform:** Circle-based community
**Format:** 52 lessons, ~6 hours total, screen recordings
**Notes:** Paul Millerd recommended as template — started lower, increased price as value increased

---

### Clawd.bot
**What:** Open-source automation tool built on Claude
**Positioning:** "Automate your life"
**Audience:** Developers, power users
**Pricing:** Free (open source)

**How we differ:**
- Product vs service + education
- For devs vs for creatives who say "I'm not technical"
- "Look what I built" vs "Look what YOU can build"
- Assumes you're past the fear vs we help you through it

---

### Atelier
**What:** Native Mac app for creative work with AI
**Positioning:** GUI wrapper for creative AI work
**Pricing:** €15/mo (BYOK — bring your own Claude API key)
**Features:** Image gen, writing, project memory

**How we differ:**
- GUI app wrapper vs terminal power
- General "creative workspace" vs specific infrastructure building
- They do it for you vs you learn to fish
- Product vs education + services

## Adjacent / Broader Players

### Anthropic Cowork (NEW — Jan 12, 2026)
**What:** Claude Code for non-developers, built by Anthropic
**Positioning:** Consumer-friendly file access for Claude
**Pricing:** Claude Max subscribers (macOS only, research preview)
**Features:** Access to one folder, skills for docs/presentations, Chrome integration

**How we differ:**
- Cowork = one folder, guardrails, consumer-friendly
- Claude Code = full system, git, scripts, custom commands, you own everything
- Cowork is training wheels, Claude Code is the bike
- The gap between easy version and powerful version never closes — it just moves

**Our angle:** Cowork is where you start. The terminal is where it gets fun.

### Alex Lieberman / Tenex
**What:** "McKinsey for AI" — enterprise consulting
**Audience:** Fortune 500 companies
**Pricing:** Enterprise contracts

**Why it doesn't matter:**
- B2B consulting vs education for individuals
- Big companies with budgets vs creatives with $50-500
- Completely different game

### Peter Yang (@petergyang)
**What:** Product lead at Roblox, creator content
**Audience:** 125K-140K newsletter, busy professionals
**Style:** Humor + practical tutorials

**Notes:** High relevance but different lane — potential collaborator, not competitor

---

### Joshua Schultz (@joshuamschultz)
**What:** Operations consultant with massive Claude Code guide (8 parts)
**Positioning:** "Cognitive amplifier" framing, "thickness hierarchy" concept
**Audience:** Business/ops professionals, not devs

**Notes:** Medium threat — different audience but similar space

## Resources / References

### Claude Code 101 Guide (lpcode808.github.io)
**What:** Free guide teaching Claude Code to non-programmers
**URL:** https://lpcode808.github.io/Claude-Code-101/

**Covers:**
- Foundational concepts (agentic AI vs chatbots)
- Terminal basics + keyboard shortcuts
- Project creation → deployment workflow
- Jargon translation for non-coders
- Tools: Git/GitHub, Netlify, Vercel, VS Code, Cursor, npm

**Teaching approach:**
- Plain language, metaphors ("texting commands to your computer")
- Progressive complexity (simple timer → full workflows)
- Addresses terminal anxiety + imposter syndrome
- "Non-technical people are doing this successfully"

**Steal for cohort:**
- "Chat vs agent" framing
- Addressing the fear directly
- Metaphor approach (npm = App Store)
- Progressive builds — start simple, get complex

## Our Positioning

**Code for Creatives** is not:
- A generic AI course
- Claude Code tutorials
- An automation tool

**Code for Creatives** is:
- Teaching creatives to build their own infrastructure
- Cohort-based, learn together
- Ownership over your creative systems
- The guide for people who outgrow the easy version

**Core message:**
> "The gap between the easy version and the powerful version never closes. It just moves. If you're willing to get your hands a little dirty, there's always more."
