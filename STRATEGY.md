# Code for Creatives — Strategy Notes

## Site Architecture Decision (Jan 2026)

**Blog lives on botharetrue.com. Code for Creatives is a focused landing page.**

### Why

1. **Both Are True is the brand** — where people know Alex, where trust lives. Code for Creatives is a *product* under that brand.

2. **The funnel:**
   - BAT newsletter/blog = top of funnel (free content, builds trust)
   - Code for Creatives = bottom of funnel (paid cohort)
   - Blog posts like "I Send Emails From My Terminal Now" live on BAT and *point to* Code for Creatives

3. **Landing pages should be tight** — focused on one job: get people to apply. Every section moves someone toward clicking "Apply." No blog, no distractions.

4. **SEO compounds on one domain** — BAT content about AI tools ranks and pulls people in. Then they discover the cohort.

### The Play

| Property | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| codeforcreatves.com | Conversion-focused landing page |
| botharetrue.com/blog | "I built this with Claude" posts, course philosophy, AI content |

Blog posts link to the cohort when relevant. The landing page stays clean.
