# Welcome Email — Cohort 1

**Subject:** You're in — next steps

---

Hey —

You're one of 5 people in the first Code for Creatives cohort. Thank you for trusting me with this.

Quick survey (2 min): **https://claude-cohort-survey.netlify.app/**

This helps me understand where you're starting from and what you want to build. Please fill it out before our first call.

**What happens next:**
- I'm finalizing dates for our 4 group calls (you'll get a calendar invite soon)
- First call will be the week of Jan 27
- Between now and then, get Claude Code installed if you haven't — I'll send simple instructions

**What to expect:**
- 4 group calls over 4 weeks
- We'll build your Creative HQ together
- You'll learn from seeing what everyone else is building too
- Lifetime access to whatever course comes out of this

If you have questions or want to say hi, just reply.

— Alex
