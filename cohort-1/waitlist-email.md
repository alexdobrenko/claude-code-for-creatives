**Subject:** Opening a few more spots for Cohort 1

Hey — quick one.

I'm opening a few more spots for the first Code for Creatives cohort.

When I was scheduling with the first five people, no single time worked for everyone — so I added a second weekly slot. That means I can fit a few more without it getting too big.

**Starts:** Week of Feb 24
**Calls:** Wednesdays 12pm ET + Thursdays 9am ET

Two sessions per week, same material — come to whichever works for you.

If you've been on the fence: this is the smallest and most hands-on it'll ever be. Five people, four weeks, we build your creative HQ together — blog publishing, invoicing, AI chief of staff, whatever you need.

$500. Weekly calls. Slack access. Lifetime access to the course I'm building from this.

Reply if you want in.

Alex
