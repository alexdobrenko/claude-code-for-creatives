# Code for Creatives: From Idea to $1,000 in One Session

**Date:** January 11, 2026
**Result:** 2 cohort spots sold = $1,000

---

## The Starting Point

- 56 waitlist signups from Tally form
- 3 discovery calls completed (Paul Millerd, Lawrence Yeo, Brian Wiesner)
- Name decided: "Code for Creatives"
- No offer, no price, no structure

---

## Phase 1: Strategic Analysis

Asked Claude to review all 3 call transcripts from 5 perspectives:

### Seth Godin
> "Pick ONE name. Say it 1000 times. Your smallest viable audience is creatives who want ownership of their tools."

### Derek Sivers
> "You forgot how impressive your setup is. $50/call is leaving money on the table."

### Sari Azout
> "This is post-platform infrastructure for creatives. Position it as AI-powered creative infrastructure."

### Robin Sloan
> "Document everything. Show your work. The building IS the content."

### Hormozi
> "You have a $5-10K service disguised as $50 calls. 56 leads sitting there. Stop being precious and sell."

## Phase 2: Offer Creation (Hormozi Mode)

Activated "Hormozi as coach" mode. Created offer stack:

**Pilot Cohort:** 5 creatives, 4 weeks, 4 group calls, $500
- Build Creative HQ together
- Learn from what everyone else is building
- Lifetime access to the course being built from this

---

## Phase 3: Email Copy

Iterated through multiple versions:
1. Added all use cases (blog publishing, invoicing, email drip, Chief of Staff, voice transcription, chatbot intake)
2. Added Paul Millerd quote with link: "Oh my God. This changes everything."
3. Removed "I'M IN" CTA (hated it)
4. Changed to "If you're interested, just reply to this email"

### Final Email

```
Subject: I'm taking 5 people through this

Hey —

You signed up for Code for Creatives. I've been doing 1:1 calls and something clicked.

Here's what I've built for myself with Claude Code:

- A blog that publishes with one keystroke — write in Obsidian, hit a shortcut, it's live
- An invoicing tool for client work
- An email drip campaign for a zine — 57 emails, custom timing, no ConvertKit needed
- A "Chief of Staff" command that reads all my projects and tells me what to focus on
- Voice-to-markdown transcription that turns rambling into organized notes
- A chatbot intake form (the one you signed up through)

I showed this to Paul Millerd last week. He watched me publish a blog post in 3 seconds and said:

"Oh my God. This changes everything."

So I'm running a pilot cohort: 5 creatives, 4 weeks, 4 group calls.

We'll build your Creative HQ together — and you'll learn from seeing what everyone else is building too.

By the end you'll have:
- Claude Code as your creative command center
- A publishing flow from your notes → your own site
- Custom tools for YOUR workflows
- A system that grows with you

5 spots. $500. And you'll get lifetime access to the course I'm building from this — you're helping me figure out what to teach.

If you're interested, just reply to this email.

— Alex

## Phase 4: Send & Results

1. Created Python script to import contacts to Loops
2. CSV parsing had issues → manually imported instead
3. Sent to 56 contacts via Loops
4. Posted in Paul's community

### Within 1 hour:
- **Meghna:** "I'm interested!"
- **Itay:** Budget objection → offered payment plan

### Result: 2 spots sold = $1,000

## Phase 5: Content Strategy

Scrolled Twitter home feed to find viral post templates:

1. **"Non-Technical Person Unlocks X"** (Nikhil Krishnan - 45K views)
   - Perfect for Alex's positioning

2. **"Fire tip I learned"** (Anais Killian - 10K views)
   - Quick actionable insight

3. **"Here's a concrete example" + screenshot** (Geoffrey Litt - 13K views)
   - Show don't tell

4. **"The reframe"** (MAILER-DAEMON - 6K views)
   - Challenge assumptions

5. **Social proof posts**
   - Quote tweets, results

### Screen Recording Ideas:
- Blog publishing in 3 seconds
- Invoicing tool in action
- Chief of Staff command
- "Watch me build X"
- This session (idea → $1,000)

## Key Learnings

1. **The offer was always there** — just needed structure and price
2. **Social proof matters** — Paul's quote did work
3. **Cohort > 1:1** — people learn from each other
4. **Just send it** — 56 people were waiting
5. **Reply-to beats CTA buttons** — feels more human
