# Call: Lawrence Yeo — Claude Code Onboarding

**Date:** Jan 9, 2026
**Type:** Onboarding / teaching session
**Duration:** ~60 min

---

## TL;DR

Lawrence is a perfect test case: respected long-form creator, zero Claude Code experience, NOT motivated by automation. His use case is long-form → short-form conversion. Key insight: he resonated with your tweet NOT because of automation but because of something he couldn't articulate — maybe the "creative HQ" vibe. The call surfaced critical teaching gaps: markdown is scarier than it needs to be, "what do I do next?" is the key question.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. The Real Barrier Isn't Technical — It's Confidence

Lawrence kept asking "am I breaking something?" and "if I don't do something beforehand, will I set it up all fucked up?"

> "I guess I can ask Claude to help me build it, but it's always like, I would rather have someone help teach it to me."

**Teaching insight:** People need permission and reassurance, not just instructions.

---

### 2. "Just Ask Claude" Is The Unlock

You said it multiple times. It's the core mindset shift.

> "I'm seeing a pattern here where you just, like, ask Claude to do the thing."

**This should be the first lesson.** Before any setup, before Agent Deck, before anything: just ask Claude.

### 3. Markdown Is Scarier Than It Needs To Be

Lawrence: "I've never really used markdown... I'm already kind of getting used to, like, okay, thinking in markdown"

Your response: "You don't need to know it."

**Teaching insight:** Lead with "you don't need to learn markdown" — remove the fear before it starts.

---

### 4. His Use Case: Long-Form → Short-Form

Not automation. Not invoicing. Not organization.

> "I think my skill is long form, and I have a hard time compressing those ideas into short form."

He's already using Claude for this. The unlock is the **iterative training loop**:
1. Give it an article
2. Get 20 short-form versions
3. Tell it which ones you like
4. It creates a voice guide markdown file
5. Next article, it's better
6. Keep improving the instruction file

**This is a teachable workflow.**

### 5. Why Your Tweet Resonated (He Couldn't Articulate It)

> "When I saw your thing, it wasn't about, like, oh, it's going to help me, right? Because if that was the angle, I don't think I'd be interested."

> "It's not really the automation angle too... It's not necessarily that I wanted to help me do shit I don't like doing."

**He doesn't know why he was drawn to it.** But he was. This is important — your positioning hits something deeper than productivity.

---

### 6. The "What Do I Do Next?" Question

> "If I hop off this call now, and it's like, all right. What do I do next? Right? I think that's, like, that's the question."

**People need clear next steps.** Not "explore and figure it out" — specific actions.

For Lawrence, you gave him:
1. Install Agent Deck (copy link, paste, ask Claude to install it)
2. Ask Claude to give you a crash course on how to use it
3. Use Claude as your buddy as you learn

### 7. Competitor Intel: Nat Eliason's Course

Lawrence is taking it. Said it "assumes zero knowledge" and starts from scratch.

> "He basically starts it off with just like, yeah, it's just zero knowledge. Everything's wiped clean. And I think that's a good place to start if you're kind of going the non coders route."

**You should probably take it** to see what he's teaching and how.

### 8. The Ownership Angle Landed

When you explained why Claude Code > Claude Desktop:

> "It's like an ownership thing almost. Right. Where, like, you're in control. As opposed to, like, who the knows how it's going to work in a month on Claude."

> "It's a lot less of a black box."

**This resonated.** Ownership, control, portability — not just "it's better."

### 9. Show, Don't Tell — The Dynamic Teaming Viz

When you showed him the website you built in 2 hours, that landed:

> "That's cool. So it's like a chat bot based upon that one essay?"

Showing real examples > explaining concepts.

## Teaching Insights for the Course

### What Worked
- Live demo with real use cases
- "Just ask Claude" repeated like a mantra
- Showing Agent Deck, then saying "you don't need it, it's just a container"
- Demystifying markdown ("you don't need to know it")
- Being honest about mistakes ("the first version really sucked")

### What to Improve
- He got confused when Claude summarized instead of copying full articles — need to teach prompt specificity earlier
- The "what do I do next?" gap — need clearer action steps at every stage
- He doesn't use Obsidian/markdown — need a path for people who don't want that

### Key Phrases to Use in Teaching
- "Just ask Claude"
- "You can't fuck up that bad"
- "You don't need to know markdown"
- "Use Claude as your buddy"
- "Back up your stuff and you're good"
