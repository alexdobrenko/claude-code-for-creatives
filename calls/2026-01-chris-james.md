**[You]** Oh, yo, what's up, man? 
**[Other]** What's up? I'm joining the Zoom now. 
**[You]** Okay, cool. Yeah, let's do that. I didn't realize that I sent this. All right, I'll see you there in a sec. 
**[Other]** No worries. We're back. 
**[You]** Yo. What's up, man? 
**[Other]** Living life. 
**[You]** Hell, yeah. What's going on? 
**[Other]** We're just downloading node node js. 
**[You]** Hell, yeah. 
**[Other]** All. This nerd is new to me. 
**[You]** You're hacking already? 
**[Other]** Doing the thing. 
**[You]** Yeah. What's your story? Tell me a little bit about you. 
**[Other]** I guess we never talked before. 
**[You]** Now we haven't. 
**[Other]** Recording in progress. I think I saw you, like, three years ago on Circle Advertising. Something like editing. Writing and editing or something. Anyways, it's been cool to see you do a bunch of different things. I'm actually kind of similar to you. 
**[You]** Did we talk back then? 
**[Other]** I don't think we ever talk. We might have just chatted in circle, but we never, like, spoke. 
**[You]** Okay? Okay. Okay. Right. 
**[Other]** Yeah, I definitely read a couple of your subject articles. I started out writing comedy. I wrote some stand up sets in 2022. 
**[You]** I remember. Okay. It's coming back that we talked. Yeah. 
**[Other]** And then. Yeah, I was kind of just. And writing funny in the beginning, and then I started writing more kind of like serious personal stories. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** And yeah. Just put a book out. Some people liked it, which is crazy. And then. Yeah. I haven't been writing a lot on Substack recently. I've more been focused on this alternative health insurance business. Which has been a fun started using AI for everything. It helps with everything from copywriting to design to actual programming, like our prototypes. So it's just so obvious that this is. It's like the alternative health insurance thing is like a great vector for me to learn about. How to use this. 
**[You]** Is that your business? The alternative health insurance thing? Like you're running that? 
**[Other]** Crowd health. I'm not running. I was. Gonna work for them. And then I decided to start my own version, which is kind of totally insane. Move. But it has to happen. Someone has to do it. 
**[You]** Okay? I've heard a lot about this, like, concept. Of like the sort of. Yeah, alternative health care or whatever. Seems very interesting. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Crowd health totally is blown up. Like, I mean, the. The pie is extremely huge, and, like, they're the size of, like, a little crumb now. But a meaningful crumb nonetheless. 
**[You]** The idea is like they only accept people who are healthy. Right. 
**[Other]** Well, not. No, I wouldn't say healthy, but, like, just not morbidly obese, which is, unfortunately, a lot of people. So. No. Morbid, obese people. 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. 
**[Other]** And then that's. I mean, honestly, that's kind of it. The reason the crowd is. The crowd is so much healthier than, like, the insurance pool of people is because it's really. Because it's been word of mouth. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** Has been their main marketing thing. So they started out with a healthy group, referring. Other healthy people, and now it's just like 20,000, like, people who, on average, have way less crazy medical bills. 
**[You]** It's kind of nuts, man. 
**[Other]** Yeah, it is nuts. I mean, but it's, like, totally saved. Saved my bot from. Going bankrupt from trying to not go bankrupt with health insurance. 
**[You]** It sucks. Health insurance blows. 
**[Other]** Yeah. So we need a lot of alternatives. Not just crowd health. So, yeah, I've been doing a lot of web design. And prototyping for that, I think I sent you the. The little backend prototype. Happy to show you. The customer facing stuff, which I've been doing more with Figma make. 
**[You]** Dude, I love Figma. Make. I. I made a whole. I made a whole website for a client in it. 
**[Other]** Really? 
**[You]** That was like, one of my true, like, holy shit moments with AI. 
**[Other]** Wow. 
**[You]** Where like the. 
**[Other]** You do like so many things. 
**[You]** Whole. Yeah. I mean it. Yeah. I work as a generalist for this one startup, for this company, and I get put on client jobs. And this one was like, build them a website. And I was like, yeah, I'm sure I could do it. And then I ended up doing all of it in Figma make. And the client was like, so happy. They were like, you're a ninja. You're so cool. I was like, I. I really did. Not do a whole lot. Like it really was. It was figma make, you know it was. Or I think they use Gemini. Pro or whatever. As their AI. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Yeah. The last guy was just on call with also said he uses Figma make. And so it's cool that people are using this because not a lot of people that I've talked to really know about it. But I just saw today Figma stock price hit like an all time low. And it's like usually when a lot of. A lot of smart people are using a product and paying for it and the stock price is going down, that's an indicator. I should look at that as an investment opportunity. I just paid for it. I think it's. I think it's nice. I like how you can copy the designs right into Figma and you can edit and like, and then send it back and you can copy the code for each section and then combine sections. 
**[You]** Totaling. Totaling. It's crazy. 
**[Other]** I just hooked up my domain name. If you can go to GetVital Co and that's by website. Just put it up. It's just a draft, but they kind of like the hero section is, like, more or less the final thing. Except that I haven't gotten our video in there. You can see. It's like an image of a surfer. It's going to be a video of people doing different activities. I just have to, I guess. Host it on Vercel to get a video in there. 
**[You]** Yeah. Yeah. I can show you. The video that I ended up. The website that I made. Made is this family biz. Because we ended up actually having this video in the background. 
**[Other]** Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dude, you got to do a video. It's way cooler. 
**[You]** Yeah. Yeah. And this is. Where did we host this? Because it wasn't. I think we put it on. Oh, yeah. Just like I think I hosted it on Cloudinary. Just like a different cloud. Service, but doesn't really matter. Yeah. 
**[Other]** Good. Good stuff, man. 
**[You]** Yeah, dude. Well. 
**[Other]** Good. 
**[You]** Tell me how I can be. What. How. What's the. What's the best way I can help you? And this. I know you're doing the cohort, too, which is sick. So we'll dive into a lot of stuff. But like what? How can I be most helpful today? 
**[Other]** Yeah, man. I just. I literally just go to Claw AI and I just start going. And that's what I do. And I don't. I don't know anything else other than that, frankly. 
**[You]** Cool. So let me. I mean, did you get. Have you set up the terminal on the terminal side or where? 
**[Other]** Yeah, I was just following your instructions, and it said if you get an error, download node node js. So I click download. And then I went to the bathroom. Then I came back, and here we are. So I don't know if that's downloaded. I don't know why, but, dude, as soon as I start seeing, like, I'll just share my screen. As soon as I start seeing nerd, my brain just turns off. 
**[You]** Y. Eah. Y. 
**[Other]** Can you see? I just requested to be able to share. 
**[You]** Ep. Yeah. Try again. This time it should work. Okay? 
**[Other]** So stuff like this is. I have a mild allergy. 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. 
**[Other]** So I think I. Look, this is in my recently downloaded. Do I have to open this or something? 
**[You]** It should if it there should be a file in your downloaded. 
**[Other]** I think I already did this. 
**[You]** Okay, so then try installing again the terminal in Clyde. Or Claude in the terminal. 
**[Other]** Is that what creates you? 
**[You]** I can only see. 
**[Other]** Okay. Damn it. 
**[You]** Yeah. I just see arc or chrome. Okay, cool. There we go. Okay, so scroll down. 
**[Other]** Give me an error. I mean, I can try again. This is what you want me to say, right? 
**[You]** Yeah. Oh, because you didn't install that yet? Yeah. Y. 
**[Other]** Dead. But. 
**[You]** Eah. 
**[Other]** Whatever. 
**[You]** Where are you based, by the way? 
**[Other]** Austin. 
**[You]** Oh, sick. Hi. Hi. You did it. You did a nap. Good job. High five. Woo. Hoo. Good job. Nice. Okay, bye. 
**[Other]** All right, so the package has installed in. 
**[You]** Ok? Ay. Sick. 
**[Other]** Try it again. 
**[You]** Y. Eah. 
**[Other]** Move the trash. I don't know. 
**[You]** Now try again. One sec. So, like, this happens a lot. In general, and the way that I usually fix it is just put all of that into clot. So I'm going to do that and see what we get. And you can do it, too. Okay? 
**[Other]** Launch cloud code on the Web. That would be sick. 
**[You]** You can do that, which might be easier. But it might be a little less powerful, right? Because then you're be here. Type. Type this into. Into. Your terminal. What I just put in the chat. 
**[Other]** I don't know. Password means. I'm going to guess. 
**[You]** That's, like, your computer's password. Whatever you use to log into your computer. 
**[Other]** I can't even, like, do anything right now. 
**[You]** No. If you type it, it's just not showing the. But it's. It's taking it in. 
**[Other]** Well, now. I don't know. I press some keys. I don't know what keys I pressed. 
**[You]** Oh, okay. So just hit enter. It'll say wrong, and then you can do it again, Yeah? Okay? Sick. Now type in claude. Sick. 
**[Other]** Is that good? 
**[You]** That's good. We're in. We're in, baby. 
**[Other]** This is huge. Life changing. 
**[You]** That's it, man. That's all I can help you with. See you later. 
**[Other]** All right, man. Take care. 
**[You]** Okay, so, yeah, pick your colors or whatever. It's all keyboard. So just hit enter on whatever you like. Yeah. And then hit enter again for cloud account. So it'll now it'll sync you with your cloud account here. 
**[Other]** I don't even know what I just did. 
**[You]** Authorize. Now go back to terminal. Enter. 
**[Other]** Why is, like, the ui so bad? 
**[You]** It's the terminal, man. It's coders. I don't give a. But it's. This is. Yeah. Say yes. Use recommended. 
**[Other]** How do I say yes? Like if it type yes. 
**[You]** No, no. Just. It's all keyboard, so just hit enter. Yep. And then hit enter. Okay? You're in. So. Yeah, man, you're. You're in it now. So now. I mean, there's a bunch of ways that we can kind of go about this, right? Like I would. What do you most want to do? Like what? What are you from a very high level, zooming out? What do you most want to use this for right now? Is there a particular use case? Do you want to just kind of use it for everything? Life management, project management ideas. You know, like, talk. Let's just talk through it for a second. 
**[Other]** Sure. So I love investing in companies via public equities. And so that's. That's how I've made my money in. In life, basically. 
**[You]** Can you teach me how to do that? 
**[Other]** As I can. Yeah, I was. Before I was going to do the health insurance thing. I was going to do a course on my solopreneur path. I was checking all the boxes, like book coaching course. And the course is going to be about. Kind of vibe investing. Which is what? A lot, actually, a lot of really good investors kind of don't really do, like, technical analysis or, like, any kind of, like. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** Academia, finance. 
**[You]** It's like what you said about Figma, right? It's like. 
**[Other]** It's basically that. 
**[You]** You get, like, a little a hit. On like something's weird. 
**[Other]** Yeah. And so that's kind of what I was going to do, just talk about my investing in purchase, basically, like, very similar to, like the Warren Buffet of investing approach. Ron Baron as well. And so I started doing some one on one coaching with people in 2025. Like I called it wealth coaching. And I started to make some tools with them, using some tools for them just on like portfolio visualization and visualizing like your wealth over time and like if you invest this much and like add this much and like, this is your. If your compound interest rate is like, 7%, which is like the average of an index fund versus, like, 12%, this is, like, the difference over time. This is why it's worth it to actually learn this and, like, try hard. Not try hard, but, like, Try a little. Put some effort in, because if you can move that. 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah. 
**[Other]** Compound annual growth rate up, even just like from 7% to 10% or 12% or 15, like, that's going to result in millions more dollars. So just anyways, I want to make more investing tools, not just for visualizing your growth, but also for, like, helping you take a look at your portfolio. Okay. Okay. Like, I had one client who had, like, 14 random stocks that he knew nothing about, and it's like, all right, well, you should probably know about the companies you own, so. It's like you can I just imagine, like software. And I think the brokers should really do this, where it's like all the financial information of the company is there, kind of extracts only the important stuff. For you, it shows, like the bear case, the bull case. The CEO's recent announcements, like an analysis of the actual products and services. What are people saying on Reddit, like a really comprehensive view of this company that you own. And what are customers saying? What are the insiders doing? So some brokers do a little bit of that. Like public has like actual financial data of the company that you own, like, they actually show it to you, which is nice. Robinhood does a little bit of showing you what insiders are doing. And they have, like, if you have the premium, they'll give you a bear case and a bull case, but, like, Something that's a little bit more tailored to, like, what. What you want, like, and also something that considers, like, your overall investment thesis. And your overall portfolio? I don't know, but I think I could code up something awesome. Even if it's just visualizing my own portfolio and just following my own companies. Like, okay, I set up an automation. So an earnings call is coming up, and I want to listen to it. Okay. It sends me notification. Okay. It sends me, like, the highlights of the earnings call. 
**[You]** That's awesome. Yeah, so, I mean. That is kind of like one bucket where, like, I would probably. Yeah. I mean. I probably just use Claude code to build that. You know? And I think you could do that. Like, we could. We could start that right now. Where you could. Literally, like, take what you just said. I don't know if you. You're recording this, too, but I. I have it in Granola. Like, I could just give. Give it to you, like what you just said, and you could paste that into. Into here. Be like, hey, help me, like, go into plan out. What a. Like an MVP of a simple web. App to do this would look like I would switch to Opus. So if you can, if you hit slash model, Opus is just a lot stronger. Just hit slash model and then enter. And then go down to open. But all with, like, your keyboard. 
**[Other]** Weird. 
**[You]** I know. And then, you know, like, I just, like. Okay, so. Let's see. If you just type in, like, help me plan out an app. And then here. I'll. I'll give you what you just said. Unless you want to just, like, describe it again. 
**[Other]** Now give me what I said. 
**[You]** Yeah. O. Ops. All right, I have to do multiple chats here. I'm going to put it into WhatsApp. Because you're over there, right? Because that it's too big for a zoom, okay? 
**[Other]** Y. 
**[You]** So. And then you could say, like, I just wrote it out. I just, like, talked it out. Here's my. Here's what I said. Like, take this and. And help me. 
**[Other]** 'all want me to write, Take this and help me. 
**[You]** Take this. And open. If you want. I mean, whatever you. Yeah, it doesn't matter. That's one cool thing about all of this is, like. You don't have to format your text. You can just kind of like, you could just put all of that in there, and it. It will parse it out and figure out the important parts. 
**[Other]** Oh, what did I do? 
**[You]** That's. Okay? Hit escape. And then type, copy, paste it. Just. Yeah. 
**[Other]** Break right here. 
**[You]** And then hit enter. 
**[Other]** Or how do I like is if I hit shift return or shift enter, is that going to give me a new line or. There's no new lines in this. 
**[You]** Yeah. No, there is. You can. But. Yeah. Ship return will do that. 
**[Other]** Shift. 
**[You]** It should. But it. But. But it. It still knows what you set up there, so it'll just combine the two. Like it, it will know. You'll be amazed at, like, how little you have to even prompt it, you know? 
**[Other]** So the other thing that's more relevant. That I should probably, like, this is like, me going down, like a side project when I have already too many projects, you know? But I actually do actually personally want some kind of portfolio visualizer. It is kind of actually important for me to have this. But the other thing is, I want, like, a system for posting online. Like, I never post on X, even though I know I'd get a lot of money from doing that, just promoting crowd health and promoting my own stuff. And. So I just hired a girl who's going to take some of my substack content and take some of my videos I've made and, you know, edited and just start posting across platforms. But I want it to be like, you know, AI forward and experiment with AI and she's cool and young and wants to experiment with AI So we're going to see if we can make a system where it's like, she's like the human in the loop. You know, curating and posting. The kind of the editor, but then the Claude and me are kind of coming up with ideas and doing research and stuff. 
**[You]** So, yeah, I mean, we could definitely build out, like, a sort of content generation. Content. Like tool. I mean, it could also do the scheduling and posting, but, you know, let it sounds like what you want more is like kind of somebody to be like brow. You want idea generation. 
**[Other]** Yeah, so. I think the process. Yeah. Would be like, idea generation. With. I mean, I think everything is going to be better. Human in the loop. Like, I think if you have, like, a smart human in the loop who knows how to work with AI, it's always going to be superior to just AI. That's kind of my thinking. 
**[You]** For sure. 
**[Other]** So, yeah, Claude could help with idea generation, remixing other people's. But ultimately I do think it should be like a human, like pressing or sort of discerning what is worth posting. Everything should be like read and posted by human. I think. 
**[You]** Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean. The way that I. I can just tell you my flow. Which is that I'm still, like, experimenting a lot, but. Like when I have something to post or when I want to, I. I'll put it into Claude code. And it has, like, my voice guide. As a markdown file that it references. And then I will be like, come up with posts with, like, some ideas for me. And then I use type fully, which is like a scheduling posting tool. That goes to x, LinkedIn threads and blue sky. And it will automatically schedule it over there. Across all of them. So. 
**[Other]** That's crazy. 
**[You]** But it sounds like, like, what do you think the part that you'd want Claude Code to do most? Is it like searching the web for ideas for you? Is it like, helping you develop some core theses that, like, you want to continually post about? 
**[Other]** Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it should be doing multiple things. There's not really, like, I guess, one big thing. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** But, yeah, it should. It should just do what has to get done to, you know, come up with content that. You know, attracts people to alternatives to health insurance. That's the. That's the point, I guess that's my purpose in investing in this, trying to attract Americans to alternatives to health insurance. 
**[You]** Cool. 
**[Other]** So. 
**[You]** So let. Let's start there. I mean, we can keep it pretty. Pretty broad, right? So. So. So this is good. This is cool. So. So go right there in Claude code. And be like, save all of this. To a markdown file so I can reference it later. 
**[Other]** This is for the finance thing. 
**[You]** Exactly. So that, like, you're not losing this, right? So that you're keeping this for the future. So that two weeks from now, you're like, hey, let's pick up the portfolio thing. And it's got all of that saved for you. 
**[Other]** Okay. Save all this to a markdown file to. What did you say? Use later. 
**[You]** To use later. Yeah. 
**[Other]** There's no, like, projects. 
**[You]** It's just all going to be like, on your computer in markdown files. 
**[Other]** Ok? 
**[You]** Yes. 
**[Other]** Ay. 
**[You]** And. Then you have to hit allow. And like, as you start to have a lot more documents, you'll want to organize it better. But right now you can just be. You can just hit allow. It's not going to actually do anything without any of this, but. Cool. So it's saved. Now let's type in. I want to build. I think this would be really good. As they're called skills. So I want to build a skill. For content. Creation. Around my alternative healthcare business or whatever, however you want to describe it. Ask me some questions. So that we can and then build it based on the results. 
**[Other]** Upstairs and charge my laptop. 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah. What part of Austin are you in? 
**[Other]** I'm in east riverside. 
**[You]** Okay? Sick. 
**[Other]** By, like. Matthew mcconaughey's house. 
**[You]** That's sick. 
**[Other]** I saw him at Walgreens yesterday. 
**[You]** You should talk to him, man. I lived in. 
**[Other]** He did not look like he wanted to talk to me. 
**[You]** That's fair. I lived in Austin for three years. 
**[Other]** Where are you now? 
**[You]** Asheville, north carolina. 
**[Other]** Oh, it's cool. I've been there. My grandpa used to live there. 
**[You]** Yeah, I loved. I loved austin, man. 
**[Other]** Yeah, it's awesome. 
**[You]** I was there. It really is. 
**[Other]** There's a bunch of cedar pond flying around, which kind of sucks. But. And it's going to be hot, as in four months, but other than that. 
**[You]** Yeah. We left. I left to go to la. I was there for, like, 12 years and then just moved to Asheville like, a year ago. 
**[Other]** Dang. How old are you? I didn't think you're that old. 
**[You]** I'm 38. 
**[Other]** Holy. I thought you were 19. 
**[You]** Wait. Actually, no. 
**[Other]** No, no. No. 
**[You]** That would be weird. But I'm glad I looked young. And I'm sad that I'm not. 
**[Other]** I didn't. Yeah, I mean, you're doing good, man. You know all about this. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** Young people stuff. 
**[You]** But this feels like a way that I can make some good money, so I'm excited. 
**[Other]** Yeah, dude, it definitely is. It's so obvious. It's so obvious. I was just at an in person. There's all these AI events here in Austin at the Capital Factory. And, like, actually, a lot of people go, Is it? AI Event every single night. And people go to all of them. 
**[You]** I mean, it's the hypiest of hype things, and it makes sense. I gotta change my fucking photo on WhatsApp. Look like an idiot. Okay, cool. So you can see. I like this mode that it's in. It's called planning mode. So. Or, like, question mode, I think they call it. So it's now choose what you want. Here. And all with the keyboard again. And I think you just hit space on each one you want. 
**[Other]** Space. 
**[You]** Just like the spacebar. But go back. Yeah. And then, like, select each one. I don't know. 
**[Other]** Holy. This is. Holy crap. This is so weird. 
**[You]** Yeah. I know. 
**[Other]** All right, so what do I. 
**[You]** So let's just go through. Go through each one and pick as many as you want. And you can do. Type something for number five if there's stuff that's missing. 
**[Other]** This is kind of comical. It's like it's really going to do all this. 
**[You]** Yeah. I mean, it doesn't. 
**[Other]** Doesn't have, like, the context to do all this, I don't think. 
**[You]** Not yet, but that's. But that. But it's. I think it's. We're building out just a skill. We're building out like a scaffolding, right? To, like. 
**[Other]** All right, so. So it doesn't have, like, what we're doing, like, basically the crowdfunding model. The crowdfunding membership, you could call it, because Crowdhouse is the only company who does it right now. My company's aspiring to be the second. 
**[You]** So I would just type all of that in right there. You know, and give it context. And then unselect that top one, too. Unless it is. Unless that one is applicable. 
**[Other]** Yeah, I would like to write about them. 
**[You]** Okay, cool. 
**[Other]** Kind of compare the two. 
**[You]** Cool. 
**[Other]** These other things I don't even. I know nothing about. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** Audience. How do I. 
**[You]** You can't click. Yeah, you got to just tab or arrows. 
**[Other]** Ok? I'm trying to arrow to the next. Do I have to go up? Oh, there we go. 
**[You]** Or you could hit Tab, too. 
**[Other]** Oh, tab works. Oh, nice. Okay. Self employed. So do I have to do this as well, do you think? 
**[You]** Yeah, just picking what you're. Who the audience is. 
**[Other]** Okay? Tab. I'm hitting tab. Nothing's happening. Just hit next. 
**[You]** Maybe you do have to go up to the top. 
**[Other]** This is, like, impossible. How do I unselect number five? 
**[You]** Enter. 
**[Other]** Enter. You sure? 
**[You]** Yeah. It says enter to select There, See right below. 
**[Other]** All right, I'm hitting tab. 
**[You]** So maybe go back up to the top. 
**[Other]** It just cycles me back down here. And there's hit. And maybe enter here. Enter to select next. Yeah, okay, whatever. That worked. Well, I want the tone to be kind of like my voice, I guess. 
**[You]** Yeah. So put that there. And then you could say, like, I'll train on my voice as we go. Or like that. That should be part of it. 
**[Other]** I wanted to read all of these. Things like these. Yeah. 
**[You]** And then just, yeah. Say it should be all of these. 
**[Other]** This is weird, man, that you can just really talk to it. Like that. Okay? Next submit. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** Is that? Are we done? 
**[You]** Yeah. Hit enter. 
**[Other]** Well, now. 
**[You]** We wait. 
**[Other]** Thinking. 
**[You]** Oh, okay. Got it. You're building a crowdfunding. I have a name. So now it's asking you some more questions. 
**[Other]** Still deciding. 
**[You]** I think you said vile, not vital. I mean, none of this is. You know, you get to edit this all. Nothing is permanent, you know? 
**[Other]** Yeah. Okay, how do we go back? Jesus christ. How do you edit this? 
**[You]** There you go. 
**[Other]** Oh, my God, dude. 
**[You]** You're hacking, man. I mean, a lot of this will be easier. Because they're going to make all of. This work inside of Claude like the app? They just launched a cowork thing yesterday, which is going to be this, so. But all of the stuff you're building and that we're doing. Will work for all of that as well, you know. Does that make sense? 
**[Other]** Yeah. Okay? Oh. 
**[You]** If I can do. If we can have one holy moment in a call, we did it. I did my job. 
**[Other]** I was saying holy because it's asking me so many questions, I'm getting overwhelmed. But also holy that's coming up with all these questions. 
**[You]** Right. 
**[Other]** So I did put in vital, but I did change it. I think you watched me change it. 
**[You]** You can just hit submit and then we can update it later. 
**[Other]** I never would have gotten this far. I would have been like, I'm. I would have been so lost. 
**[You]** Yeah. You seem very allergic to, like, just the. The terminal, which makes sense. 
**[Other]** I don't like. Yeah. The I like things that I. Clicking buttons, not, like, terminal thing. This is the first time in my life I've used a terminal. 
**[You]** Yeah. I mean, I think almost everybody. Is is in your shoes, right? Skill action. Generate from topic content, calendar repurpose content, all the above. 
**[Other]** I don't know what this means. Do you know what this means? 
**[You]** All of the above. 
**[Other]** All right, let's. Let's do that. 
**[You]** Yeah. Compliance. Disclaimers. Do you need to add disclaimers? Okay, skip it. 
**[Other]** No. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** So. 
**[You]** Then hit yes and do number two. 
**[Other]** Like that. Is there like automations over time where it's gonna like, continuously do for me, like every day it comes up with like, what's the new thing that people are talking about? Okay, how can that new thing apply to our thing? What are some funny posts? What are some, like, how to posts? 
**[You]** That. I mean, we can definitely do all of that. That requires a little more than this. But. Hit? Yes. And allow all edits. Once we're done here, we're going to also just. We'll need to update it to vital because it's saying vial everywhere. 
**[Other]** I know. Whatever. 
**[You]** So that requires, like, automations. Okay, cool. So I would say, like right now, hey, just update everything to vital health, not vial. Then to hit two. And then. Hit 2. Yeah. 
**[Other]** Swooping. 
**[You]** Done, okay? So what you're asking about is, like, a little more advanced. I don't think we can cover it in, like, 20 minutes, but that's something we could do, like, with the cohort. So quit. Out of terminal right now. And let's and reopen terminal. So, like, let's imagine you're just, you know, like, yeah, hit, terminate. Then do a new terminal type in Claude. Hit? Yes. And then type in. V. Or. 
**[Other]** Dice. 
**[You]** Okay, that's weird. So then type in. Make it so that my slash. Vital health. Command runs as a slash command or whatever. 
**[Other]** Make it so Final command runs as. 
**[You]** Runs as a slash command in Claude code. It's weird that it didn't do that automatically. 
**[Other]** Check out this cowork thing. 
**[You]** So you have to have. The max plan. Which is 100 bucks a month to use it. 
**[Other]** Jeez. 
**[You]** Just essentially do what. What you're. It is just more visual, so it might be better for you, if you want. 
**[Other]** Sure. Yeah, Because I love what I love about this. Coding within Claude. Is that you get this. Like I can just. Prompt, and the thing just pops up right here. I mean, that's so easy. How could it be any easier? Anyways. 
**[You]** Say look for. Look for the vital. Did it. Save it. I think. It should have. Look for the vital command in my files. Yeah. Hello. It's probably going to do a couple others. Yeah. Just hit the two again. 
**[Other]** Like scanning all my. Here. Is that what's going on? 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** I don't know. 
**[You]** Sorry. 
**[Other]** I don't know what's going on here. Do you want me Just keep hitting two. 
**[You]** Yeah. Yeah. 
**[Other]** So is it looking for my file that we just created? 
**[You]** Yeah. But if you. If you go to Finder, too, and maybe we just have to, like and open a new one. Go to chris or. 
**[Other]** I don't know. 
**[You]** And then hit two back there. Yeah. Okay, There it is. It just found it. I just saw. You could even say, yeah, Vital health content md. Yeah. So it's got it there. Okay, I found it. Let me read it, see how it's configured, and make it work as a slash command. Cool. It's annoying that it didn't do that. Head 2. Work. You couldn't vote it by vital. Okay? All right. Let's quit out again. Terminate. And then restart. 
**[Other]** This is wild, dude. This is, like, primitive. 
**[You]** Yeah. Yeah. But. Primitive but super powerful, right? Because, like, you know, for example, like, what you're showing me, like, the JS stuff, right? That, like, infrastructure for your thing? Like, you can look at it, but you're not going to be able to actually, like, implement it onto a website. Without, like, something a little deeper in the code. If that makes sense. You know what I mean? 
**[Other]** What JS stuff. I don't know what you're talking about. 
**[You]** Oh, the thing. The. That you're showing me the bills and negotiation, like, the. Like actually making a website, a platform. Like, you can have the front end, but like, to actually code it and make it work. You're going to need to, like. Put that code somewhere and have it. Working. And that's going to be a lot easier with Claude code or something that has access to. That has access to your computer. Or. Or the coworker, I think could also possibly do it. We can see, but anyways. But. But if. If you go back to. Yeah, so type in Claude. 
**[Other]** Or just claude. 
**[You]** Just claude. 
**[Other]** Okay? 
**[You]** So that's always how you start. Claude code is type in Claude. And hit? Yes. 
**[Other]** Okay? Yes. Continue. 
**[You]** And then now try. Vital. What the. That. 's annoying. Just hit enter. Yeah, Just say, like. I just set this up as a skill. It should be working. Why isn't it working? Type in skill. Yeah, and then hit enter on that. Skill configuration. Skill name. Type in skills like that and see. Yeah. It's called. Vital md. Just say it's called Vital md. Hit escape and then Vital md. Weird. But this is kind of a good example of, like, Often doesn't work, and you have to. You know, kind of troubleshoot with Claude. Head 2. You should now be able to use it. Try. Writing. Okay? I bet you're going to try. Just try typing in vital. I bet you'll have to. Oh, there it is. Sick. Okay, hit enter. All right. Okay, cool. So now this is like, you can run this. And it will help you with content. Now, obviously, it's still pretty. Boilerplate, right? Like, we haven't really, like, done a whole lot to it. To make it yours. So now I would say the next step is to, like, train it a little bit more on your voice and what kind of content you want help with. And as you're doing it, When, like, constantly or not constantly, but tell it to be like, hey, update the. Update or create a voice guide. For me so that you have. So that you reference it the next time that we do this together. Does that make sense? 
**[Other]** Cool, so. 
**[You]** Is this tracking? Is this helpful or. 
**[Other]** Yeah, I couldn't get it. It has yet it now. I didn't kind of get it that it has just access to all your files and your computer and you can create and update files, but it doesn't necessarily have automations built in. 
**[You]** No, but we can do that. That's kind of just like another layer that we can do. It's just going to be a little more complicated. But not impossible at all. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Automation is just like, the thing that. That I need to learn. Because once you have that. Once you have that, and then you have, like, agents. Then you have a pretty powerful thing going. 
**[You]** Right. Right. I think. One thing that could be good is to map out what your ideal, what you would want the agents to do on a regular basis. And then we can, like, build out together what it is that, like, how it would do that, you know what I mean? Like. Does that make sense? Yeah. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Well, like you just have to. Kind of work backwards from, like, the desired final outcome. 
**[You]** Yeah. So what is. What's the outcome for you? 
**[Other]** Which is like. The outcome of this. Like near term media campaign is to get 100 people signed up for crowd health. So we have 21 so far. From some substack posts. And some Facebook ads. So. The ads thing kind of worked, but it's, like, really clear that organic is going to be, like, by far the best bang for your buck. So just like. The outcome is people using my referral code to sign up for crowd health. And then how we get there is like creating content and posting it across social media channels. 
**[You]** But. But. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** And then. So what do you want an agent to be helping you with in that process? Right. Like, is it. Knowing the active conversations happening across social and then reacting to them. Is it creating content for or creating topics for your human in the loop to be helping with? Like what is. The. What's the pain point that we're going to solve for here? You know what I mean? 
**[Other]** Yeah. I mean, what you said is. Is. Is right? I mean, creating. Yeah. Like research, ideation, drafting. I. I don't love the idea of, like, it. I don't want to just be, like, posting. Like, I don't. But, yeah, I mean, there's that. That's kind of like the process, I suppose. I mean, my creative process is just such a mess that I can't even. It doesn't even, like, translate to this. I don't even know you know what I mean? 
**[You]** Now. Right. Right. 
**[Other]** I don't have a creative process. It's. It's just. It's not. It's undefined, you know, so. Which is the reason why. I don't post consistently. So I've never attempted to create a process or get myself to do a process. 
**[You]** Totally. 
**[Other]** So this is all new to me. 
**[You]** Totally. Yeah. I guess the other big question is, like, Do you want something that, like, I can help you build. Or do you want to learn how to build something? You know what I mean? Because, like, those are sort of different things. One is kind of like one level abstracted from the other. Whereas, like, I can. Like, I can help you work out the details of how to build this thing. And, like. Or we can. I can show you kind of, like, how to build anything, and then you can, you know, how to build this and also build other things. That second option would just be a lot more, like, annoying. You know, like, it would be a lot more like, you'd have to do a lot of more, like. Man. Ual. Primitive stuff to use your language of like. Because I can tell you get pretty frustrated. Right? Like, you're just like. This is kind of a. You're annoyed. So I don't want you to, like, send you deep into the. Like, into the world of, like. This stuff where it is pretty annoying to, like, have to. Figure out how to, like, solve each little problem. Or I can. We can be like, let's make something for you that works, right? Those are. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Let's just make something that works. 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I figured. Cool. That's great. I mean. That I think we can do in this cohort. I can also try to help you a little bit. Outside of that. But yeah. Does that. Yeah. Like where? Where? How do you leave this conversation feeling? Do you feel like we accomplish something? You can be honest. 
**[Other]** Well, we. I mean, we certainly did some things. I don't know if we accomplished, but we did do. I am using the terminal. I think. I don't. I don't exactly know what. I think we created a skill. There's, like, I guess, product created here, but I. I do, I did certainly learn. I think the main takeaway for me is, like, I'm probably not going to use the terminal because I'm just not liking it so far. I mean, I'll give it, like, more of a chance, but I'M pretty sure I'll probably end up doing the next iteration of this, like Cowork or whatever comes later, where it's just a little bit more of a user friendly interface. I think. Yeah. I mean, we definitely got caught up doing, like, whatever. Frankly, I don't even understand, like, there's a skill. This skill didn't get created. We had to kind of get it to create a skill. I think if I, like, if I literally had just put an hour into coding like the other with Claude AI, I probably would have, like, a sort of a product I could use right now. So. That's kind of. That's just my thoughts. 
**[You]** So then why are you interested in Claude code? Right? Like, why not just use cloud AI? 
**[Other]** Yeah. Well, that's kind of the question I had for you. And I think I kind of understand the answer now, which is that, you know, one this is more powerful. And it can create. It can access and create more files on your computer rather than with Claude AI. You create a project, you add some files. But it's not really creating new files. And there's probably other things. I mean, if I know. 
**[You]** Right. Yeah. I think it'd be cool for you to just, like, try doing this. In Claude AI and see how far you get, because I'm curious, like. Where. Yeah. What. What the need is here because we. You know, I don't want to, like, just get you using this terminal or. Or just. Because, you know, for fun. Unless you want to. But it sounds like you don't really want to. You know? 
**[Other]** Yeah. My thinking is, like, I. I never would have gotten this far without you telling me what to press. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** And so I probably won't be using this, like, in my own free time. And then it sounds like they're coming out with, like, a wrapper for this, like they already have. It's called Cowork. So in the middle of this, I was like, wait, why am I learning all these terminal skills if I'm going to use the next version very soon? Which is going to be a different ui. 
**[You]** We're just. Going to. I mean, do you want to. I mean, I get you would have to upgrade to the $100 version. I don't know if you want to do that, but. 
**[Other]** I try to, like, join the waitlist yesterday. I imagine they're going to see how many people upgrade to $100, and then they're going to, like, release it to everybody else. I mean, I will upgrade to the I don't care. $100. Whatever. 
**[You]** Yeah, totally. Your call, man. I mean, you know, I think I just. You. You tell me how I can most be helpful, right? Because they are definitely different skills, right? They are. Yeah. I don't know. I. I don't feel. I feel like I'm not being as helpful as I can be here. 
**[Other]** I have to take all of you. This co work thing, maybe they'll like, I want to maybe just watch some YouTube videos and see, like, is it. Because if it's going to be as powerful as this, but just a easier UI for me, then I'll just go without. I think. Yeah, I still don't really know how to build what I want to build. I guess maybe you just provide me some insights, like we talked about. Those two ideas, like the finance thing, and then like the. The social media content machine. I don't fully understand what it is that we built. And then also like, I think you understand my idea of like. It runs regular automations kind of coming up with ideas. We have a human in the loop to like review those ideas. Kind of tell it to proceed, like fleshing out those ideas and then approve things for posting. I guess my question is, like, what do I. What do I need to know or do to, like, make that a reality? 
**[You]** Right. And, like, there's sort of two answers to that, right? One is I can just, like, help you build it or build it for you. I think that would be pretty easy for me. Or I can, like, show you how to do it. The second one's a lot harder. For you. Right. And so that's sort of my. Because, like, so I. Did you. I just shared my screen for a second. Did you see that? 
**[Other]** No, actually, I can't see. 
**[You]** Okay. Can you see it now? 
**[Other]** It. Alex Aben has close tab. It just gave me a message, but it disappeared. Told me to close a tab. Oh, I see. Oh, it went away. What the. 
**[You]** Yeah, I just closed it. Let me, let me. Okay. 
**[Other]** Oh, go again. Okay, there we go. 
**[You]** Cool. So this is cowork. This is what cowork looks like, right? So basically, like, it lets you crunch data, prep, organize files. I mean, it's really basic right now. Send messages, make prototypes. So it's not. It's, like, what you want to do. Is like, especially for that second one. Is something that requires some automations. It requires maybe what I can do just as like a thing so that you feel like you got something out of this is like, I'll show you, I'll send you a little like, map of here's how you could build that automation thing. Or how I could do it. Or how you could do it. You know? And then you can be like, cool, this is how I would want to do that, or whatever. You can figure it out, or we can do it together in the cohort. We'll figure it out, but that's. That's. I think what maybe would be helpful for you. 
**[Other]** Yeah, I think I've done, like, a lot of, like, coaching and teaching stuff. And, like, when someone's like, yeah, brand new. Like, I'm pretty much brand new to this. Like, I think, like, yeah, they have to see someone else do it, and then they do it. So I'm definitely down to, like, watch you do it, and then I'll give it a shot. 
**[You]** Cool. Cool. And it's something we can do in the cohort, too, because I'm sure that use case is, like, a good one for everybody, right? 
**[Other]** Everybody wants the content machine. 
**[You]** Totally, totally. Like, that can even be, like, one of the pillars of what we do is, like, how to make your own little content machine. Right. I have ideas. I have a lot of thoughts and ideas and. 
**[Other]** Yeah. And like. The other, the other thought thing is, like, I guess it would be cool to, like, come up with almost like your own algorithm. Like, you have, like, the. For you and X, and then you have, like, the following. But, like, coming up with, like, an AI that's almost like, ambiently monitoring what's. What tweets or whatever going out. And then it's like, okay, this was a good one for you to reply to, because when you're a new account, you have to reply to, like, get eyes. To be like, okay, you could reply to this tweet with this graphic that we already made, or we could make. 
**[You]** Yeah, like that. I couldn't. I can show you how to build. 
**[Other]** You know? 
**[You]** Cool. 
**[Other]** That's my main focus, actually, for 2025, is like, Just scaling up, like, getting more eyeballs on crowd health, on the industry, on what I'm building on my personal brand. Just, like, scaling because, like, to start a startup, you just have to, like, have a lot of people involved. A lot of smart people need to, like, see your personal brand and what you're working. On. 
**[You]** Okay? 
**[Other]** And so you got to get investors, employees, customers. So I think growing my online communities gonna help a lot. 
**[You]** Totaling. Yeah. I mean, that's usually what I do for clients, is like, content strategy, so, you know, happy to jam on that and share ideas. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** Too. 
**[Other]** Great. Yeah. The alternative health insurance world is absolutely blowing up right now, and it's like super early days. 
**[You]** Yeah, man. 
**[Other]** So. 
**[You]** Are you trying to. Is on Twitter? Your personal Twitter or a company Twitter? Which one? 
**[Other]** I'm just doing my personal x account. It's @ chris james, usa. I think I tagged you on something. 
**[You]** Oh, yeah. There you are. Cool. 
**[Other]** Yeah, I don't really post there, but I'm pretty good at talking into a mic. So I can kind of. If the AI can come up with a script, I can enthusiastically say it into the camera. 
**[You]** Yeah, man. I mean, honestly, like, if you just. Right now, after we get off, just. You know, talking, like, talking to your voice note and just record a voice Note for, like, 10 minutes about why you care about all this stuff. Like, we could turn that into posts for you, right? Like, that's. 
**[Other]** Dude, I have so much content already created. 
**[You]** Okay, so then you don't need that, okay? 
**[Other]** And I would. I would also rant. I'll do a podcast with someone. And that'll it helps me come up with good ideas and talk well when I'm speaking with someone else. So I'll do a pod and then we'll feed that all into AI. That's the other thing. Man is like, I think I have so much content created. I've written a book. I've done 25 podcasts. I've written a hundred blog posts. So it's like I should really take all that data and create some mega voice file or whatever. 
**[You]** So why? So let's do that. 
**[Other]** Well, that's. That's a good idea. 
**[You]** Right. Yeah, it seems like we just got to do it. 
**[Other]** Yeah. I don't know. Like what? What are the steps? What are the next. I mean, ask Claude how to do it. 
**[You]** For real? Yes, for one, but two? Yeah, I can help you with that, too. You know, these are all, like. Good things to help to work together on and do in the cohort or outside of it or whatever. I'm learning, too, how I can, like, be helpful to people. Right? Like, if it's, like, building custom builds. Classes like you can. You can help me figure out how I can help you. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** You know what I mean? 
**[Other]** Yeah, no, I'm happy to do that. Yeah, so, like. Whenever I when I taught mountain biking and skiing for years. 
**[You]** That's sick. 
**[Other]** And so it's just kind of like the mental model was always like, basically, tell them what we're doing. Like, you talk about it and then you show it to them, and then you have them do it and you supervise them doing it and kind of give them real time feedback. And so I just apply that to this. Be like, Maybe even. Kind of say how, how you build things and maybe even show, like, some graphic of, like, it's more or less like, goes like this, and then do the thing in front of them and then be like, okay, now you're going to build this, or you're going to build what we just built. What you're going to do it, even if it's like, them writing, like, the exact prompts or whatever. 
**[You]** Yeah, totally. And I can make videos about that, too, because I'm trying to make more videos. 
**[Other]** Right. And. And yeah, that's the other thing is just I feel like the hybrid model of like a course where like you have them watch videos and then also you do some like one on one and then some group work. Like that's, that's the best. I didn't buy now license course because. You're just buying videos. And I didn't feel like that was enough for me to want to do it. 
**[You]** Totally totaling. Yeah. 
**[Other]** So I think the best course I've ever taken was Joe Hudson's. 
**[You]** Right. You brought that up. Yeah, yeah. 
**[Other]** Yeah, so? And nervous system mastery was really great as well. But they have the, like, partner work, and then they have the group work, and then they have the whole cohort kind of seminars, and then they have the solo work, which is watching videos. So I think all of that makes sense. Like, you have some videos that your customers watch. And then you partner people up to do, like, some thing, some activity or something. And then you have, like, the cohort, like the group sessions. 
**[You]** Yeah. Cool, man. Let's keep. Let's keep jamming. And. Yeah, we've got the cohort thing in the books. And I'll get you some thoughts just after this of, like, here's what I. Where I think you could go and how you could do a lot of this and how I can. Help. And you tell me if that's annoying or cool or what. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Yeah. I would love to see, like, your approach to the content machine and just, like, how you would do it. If you want to make a video of you doing it, I'm sure that would be helpful for not just me, but other people. And then. Yeah, to see you create it and then send it to me would be awesome. 
**[You]** Cool. All right. Sounds good, man. Thank you. See you later. 
**[Other]** See you later. 
**[You]** Bye.
