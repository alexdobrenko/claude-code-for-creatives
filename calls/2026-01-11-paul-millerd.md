## Key Moments

### Paul's Situation
- In Vietnam with family, traveling village with 20 other families for 4.5 months
- Expecting second kid in July
- Planning mini sabbatical (1.5 months) to think about next 5 years
- Daughter just turned 3, hitting "totally unhinged" phase

### Paul's Technical Level
- Has used Cursor, hit friction with advanced stuff

- Already on Claude API from April
- "I'm past the fear" of breaking things

## What Alex Showed

1. **The core philosophy:** You own all the files. Everything is markdown on your computer.

2. **Agent Deck** — Terminal command center for managing multiple Claude sessions

3. **Chief of Staff command** with values baked in — helps with weekly planning against personal values

4. **Iterative learning:** "I'm always having it learn from what has just happened"
   - After sessions, update Claude so it knows for the future
   - Both automated and manual flagging of lessons

5. **Health data analysis** — Paul dumped all his health PDFs/CSVs and Claude analyzed them instantly

6. **The intake form** — Chatbot-style survey using Claude API + Resend for email notifications

7. **Blog publishing workflow:**
   - Write in Obsidian
   - Move to "Ready to publish" folder
   - Run script (keyboard shortcut)
   - Automatically publishes to blog via Netlify
   - "Hi Paul" post went live in seconds during the call

## Paul's Reactions

> "This is wild."

> "This is going to be amazing."

> "Oh my God. This changes everything." (on the blog publishing flow)

> "This is like changing how I think about everything."

> "You should just record an overview of this because this stuff is so interesting compared to the Hustle Bros just like 'you just had a 10x your MMR'"

## Paul's Advice for Alex

### On the calls:
- **Ask more upfront:** "What do you want to get out of this hour?"
- **Get them to accomplish ONE task** — get them in terminal and set up ASAP
- **Screen record** the cool stuff (like the values in chief-of-staff command)
- **Ask after:** "If I were to offer ongoing things, what would you want?"

### On monetization:
- "Our kind of writing doesn't help people make money. This can help people directly make money."
- Start with one-off calls → workshop → course (natural progression)
- Reference: **Nate Eliason's "How to Code with AI" course** ($500, Circle-based)
  - 52 lessons, ~6 hours total
  - Screen recordings of him building things
  - Started lower, increased price as value increased
- "Don't be ashamed to sell this to people"

### On positioning:
- "Code for Creatives is good" (vs Code for Humans)
- "You're in a great position... you actually care about creatives and you've been doing all the creative weird stuff for years"
- The human/soul layer is the differentiator — "nobody's thinking about this, they're just thinking about building apps"

### On community:
- Paul offered to create a "Claude for Creatives" channel in his community
- Wants to have Alex be the person he sends people to for Claude Code stuff
- Open source economy model — people can spin up sub-channels and make money

## Funny Moment: Claude Compares Writers

Paul asked Claude to compare their writing:

> **On Paul:** "Yes [you're a good writer]. Not in a clever prose way. Your sentences aren't particularly beautiful."

> **On Alex:** "Alex is a performer. His writing is a bit neurotic. Guy voice absurdist escalation. Comedic timing in the white space."

> **The verdict:** "If the question is who's more skilled at prose craft, probably Alex. If the question is who's saying something that matters, it's you."

> "Both valid. Different audiences, different needs."

## Quotable

**Paul on the opportunity:**
> "This is infinitely expanding. This is like blowing open the economy right now."

**Alex on the skill required:**
> "You have to have a really strong level of... I'm gonna fix this until it works. A lot of stuff, like making Resend work, took me a few days. That's basically still what coders do. It's just not as annoying."

**Paul on why Alex is positioned well:**
> "You actually care about creatives and you've been doing all the creative weird stuff for years, freelancing and writing."
