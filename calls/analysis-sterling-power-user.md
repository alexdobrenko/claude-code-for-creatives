## Who Is Sterling?

Sterling is a 35-ish year old entrepreneur based in New York with an impressive background:

- **Decade at Vice (2009-2018):** Started as a 22-year-old intern, worked his way up by being "the token millennial who understood the Internet." Built whatever the next thing was for the company. Classic "make yourself indispensable" trajectory.

- **Clubhouse breakout:** After Vice, became one of the top 100 users on Clubhouse with 300,000 followers. First time creating anything publicly after years behind the scenes.

- **Network connected:** Knows Paul Millerd, Sari (Sublime founder), invested small amounts in startups to "get the investor updates and be your friend." Builds relationships strategically.

- **Recent ADHD diagnosis:** Only diagnosed last year. Has a ~3-year-old son. The diagnosis was "catalyzed by the fact that I broke after we had our kid."

- **Current business:** Runs a consultancy helping people "spend the highest percentage of time in your zone of genius." Website describes building systems for creative entrepreneurs.

**Why Sterling matters as a data point:**

He represents the "perfect storm" user - someone with:
1. High-level strategic thinking (decade of corporate experience)
2. ADHD brain that maps perfectly to Claude Code's workflow
3. No coding background but high tech fluency
4. Business that benefits from meta-work and systems thinking
5. Only 72 hours into Claude Code but already building sophisticated systems

## His Systems & Workflows

Sterling has built what he calls a "system for how I work" in just 4 days. Key components:

### Skills He's Created:
- **Capture:** Brain dump routing system - "route it wherever the fuck it needs to go"
- **Kickoff:** Commence each work session with context loading
- **Checkpoint:** Save state at midpoints or when ending sessions
- **Patterns.md:** Tracks recurring behaviors that haven't yet become skills
- **Skill graduation curve:** If he does something multiple times, system prompts "should this become a skill?"

### System Architecture:
- **Master-level to-dos** and **project-level to-dos** (separate but connected)
- **Scoreboard** - tracking system for work output
- **Constitution** - guiding principles for how the system operates
- **System Architecture document** - auto-generated, updates itself
- **Per-skill learnings files** - each skill has its own learnings capture

### Multi-Session Workflow:
- Runs multiple Claude sessions concurrently
- One session for "the actual work"
- One session for "meta work" (notes, system improvements)
- Dumps deviant ideas into the meta session to stay focused

### Meeting Integration Vision:
Plans to build a system that:
1. Runs both Granola AND Clarify for every meeting
2. Compares transcript lengths to use the better one
3. Extracts video for object recognition (slides, presentations)
4. Routes transcripts to relevant project folders
5. Has Claude Code auto-detect new transcripts and pull context

### Agent Understanding:
- Uses "disposable agents" for research (spin up 10 sub-agents to red-team a proposal)
- Uses orchestrator agents to coordinate feedback
- Understands agents vs skills distinction: "Skills are atomic composable units that you can then give to agents to run"

## Key Quotes

### On ADHD and Claude Code:
> "This is like the moment that I've been waiting for my whole fucking life. I feel like the world just finally met me where I am. There's been something wrong with me, and I didn't know what it was... The way that the tools and software and system, the way that it was all designed, just wasn't mapped to the way that... it wasn't like a bespoke suit. You know what I mean? I was still trying to look good in some off the rack shit."

### On Productivity Transformation:
> "The last 72 hours have been the most productive of my life."

> "I'm happier and more content because I'm more productive, and I feel like it works for me. And I'm just proud of my days at work. And when's the last time I fucking felt proud of a day of work?"

### On Meta-Work and ADHD:
> "Obviously my issue is the metal work always distracts me from doing the actual work I need to do. But when I'm doing the actual work and then there's contextually relevant meta work, I make notes about that in that same session. But then when I have ideas of things that would be deviations from the thing that I'm trying to do in that session, I could just dump it in the other session."

### On External Systems:
> "My mind is just... there's too much going on, and so I know that if I hold on to it, I'm going to feel overwhelmed. And if I externalize it? The problem with my externalization systems is I've gotten so overwhelmed by the fact that I can't manage that externalized context. And I can't review properly. The systems don't talk to each other."

### On the Moment We're In:
> "There are all these things that have been written about how this is going to be a runaway year where people who get it are going to run away from people who don't. And it's just very, very true."

### On Skills vs Agents Architecture:
> "It's structurally incorrect to focus on putting skills into the agent. You want skills to be atomic units, discrete from an agent. And an agent can call on skills because then skills become composable. And they're not like, lost, buried in the context of an individual agent."

### On the AI Ethics Question:
> "You can be a Luddite and say, this doesn't work because it's going to displace jobs... But is it unethical for creative people to use it in business operations or creative operations? Is it unethical for you to fucking add subtitles?"

## What This Reveals

### What "Advanced" Looks Like in Claude Code World:

1. **System architecture thinking:** Not just using Claude Code for tasks, but building systems for how you work. The meta-work becomes a first-class citizen.

2. **Multiple concurrent sessions:** Using different sessions for different purposes (work vs meta-work), treating Claude Code like a multi-threaded operating system for your brain.

3. **Skill graduation patterns:** Noticing when patterns should become formalized skills. Building in self-improvement loops.

4. **Context management:** Sophisticated approaches to loading context, checkpointing state, and maintaining continuity across sessions.

5. **Disposable agents for research:** Using sub-agents strategically for specific tasks (red-teaming, research) without building permanent infrastructure.

### What's the Ceiling for Non-Coders?

Sterling demonstrates there may not be a ceiling. In 4 days, he built:
- A full system architecture
- Multiple custom skills
- Pattern detection systems
- Multi-session workflows
- Integration plans with external tools (Clarify, Granola)

The limiting factor isn't coding ability - it's:
- Conceptual understanding of systems
- Willingness to think in terms of workflows
- Comfort with iteration and meta-work
- Raw hours invested in exploration

### Patterns That Could Be Taught to Beginners:

1. **Capture skill:** Everyone should have a "brain dump" mechanism
2. **Kickoff/Checkpoint pattern:** Session management for continuity
3. **Learnings files:** Every skill/project should accumulate learnings
4. **Work vs meta-work sessions:** Use multiple sessions for different purposes
5. **Skill graduation:** When does a pattern become a skill?
6. **Scoreboard concept:** Tracking outputs to feel productive

## Course Implications

### Is Sterling the Aspirational Outcome?

Yes and no.

**Yes:** Sterling represents what's possible when someone with strategic thinking + ADHD brain + high motivation encounters Claude Code. His 72-hour transformation is the dream state.

**No:** His background (decade at Vice, Clubhouse success, existing business) means he has context many beginners won't have. He's also more systems-oriented than many creatives.

**Better framing:** Sterling is the "what happens when it really clicks" story. The course should help people get to that click moment faster.

### Should His Techniques Be in the Curriculum?

Definitely. Key candidates:

1. **The Capture skill** - Universal utility, low barrier
2. **Kickoff/Checkpoint pattern** - Essential for session continuity
3. **Skills vs Agents mental model** - Conceptual clarity
4. **Multiple session strategy** - Work vs meta-work
5. **Pattern graduation** - When to formalize behaviors
6. **System architecture doc** - Having Claude document your system

### How Does Knowing Power Users Exist Change Positioning?

1. **Proof of ceiling:** Show that non-coders can build sophisticated systems. "Here's what 72 hours looks like for the right person."

2. **Aspiration marketing:** Sterling's story is compelling - the ADHD brain finally finding its tool, the "most productive 72 hours of my life."

3. **Community value:** Power users like Sterling would be incredibly valuable in a cohort - they can help others and share systems.

4. **Tiered outcomes:** Not everyone will become Sterling, but showing what's possible helps people understand they're not just learning a tool, they're learning a new way of operating.

## The "Advanced Student" Profile

Sterling represents a specific archetype - the **Strategic Systems Builder**:

### Characteristics:
- High conceptual ability, low code ability
- ADHD or ADHD-adjacent thinking patterns
- Already runs a business or has complex work
- Comfortable with abstraction and meta-thinking
- Previous experience building systems (even if they failed)
- Motivation tied to productivity and "proud of my work day"

### What They Need:
- Permission to go deep
- Frameworks for organizing complexity
- Validation that non-coders can do this
- Community of similar people to share systems with
- Maybe just exposure - they'll figure it out fast once they see what's possible

### What They Bring:
- Advanced use cases to learn from
- Systems that can be taught to others
- Validation of the course's upper bound
- Potential collaborators/community leaders

### Course Fit:
Sterling might actually be better as a guest/collaborator than a student. But students with his characteristics will move fast and become advocates.

## Notable Side Threads

### The AI Ethics Conversation:
Sterling has a sophisticated take: "You can think about AI in business operations, creative operations, and creative production. The biggest ethical issue is in creative production... but is it unethical for creative people to use it in business operations?"

This maps to Alex's positioning challenge - how to be an "AI guy" without losing the artist credibility.

### The Collaboration Offer:
Sterling offered to make Alex a "guinea pig" for his tools - essentially offering to help Alex build a sustainable creative business using Claude Code systems. This is interesting positioning for potential future collaboration.

### The "Both Are True" Meta-Commentary:
Sterling explicitly names that Alex's brand positioning ("I'm an artist who also uses AI tools") is actually perfectly aligned with "Both Are True" - the documentation of wrestling with both identities. This is marketing insight worth noting.

## Summary

Sterling is a power user who demonstrates the upper bound of what non-coders can achieve with Claude Code in a very short time. His systems-thinking background, ADHD brain, and existing business context made him the perfect candidate for rapid adoption.

Key takeaways for the course:
1. The transformation can happen in 72 hours for the right person
2. ADHD brains seem particularly well-suited to Claude Code
3. System architecture thinking is the differentiator between users and power users
4. His specific techniques (Capture, Kickoff, Checkpoint, Scoreboard) should probably be in the curriculum
5. Power users can become community assets and validation stories

The question isn't "can non-coders do this?" - Sterling proves they can. The question is "how do we help more people get to the click moment?"
