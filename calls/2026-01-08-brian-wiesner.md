# Call: Brian Wiesner — Creative Career & Coding Brainstorm

**Date:** Jan 8, 2026
**Type:** Potential client / collaborator discovery call
**Duration:** ~45 min (estimate)

---

## TL;DR

Brian is a potential early adopter AND collaborator. He has deep experience in online marketing, VA hiring, and video production. He wants exactly what you're building: help transitioning to Obsidian + building a digital home (POSSE model). Offered to trade — you help him set up, he helps you with marketing/packaging/video editing pipeline.

---

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Product Validation — "Digital Home" Setup
Brian articulated the exact problem you solve:
> "I was one of those people that wanted to start blogging... I bought a domain and was like, damn, there's way more that goes into this than I thought."

He wants:
- Obsidian setup (transitioning from Notion)
- Publishing flow to his own site
- Understanding POSSE (Publish Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere)

**This is a clear $200-500 service.**

### 2. Two-Tier Product Model (His Suggestion)
Brian literally gave you the product ladder:

| Tier | Price | What |
|------|-------|------|
| DIY | $25-50 | Gumroad product, plug at bottom of newsletters |
| Premium | $200+ | "We work together for a month to build your digital home" |

### 3. The "Digital Home" Framing
Brian's language: "helping people build their digital identity" / "digital home"

This is cleaner than "Claude Code for creatives" for certain audiences. Consider using both:
- **Technical audience:** Claude Code for Creatives
- **Creative audience:** Build Your Digital Home

### 4. Instagram/Video Feedback
Brian's specific advice:
- Your camera presence is great
- Missing: **thumbnails and packaging** so people know what each video is about
- Suggestion: Mix funny takes on social media + serious coding/building content
- Don't separate comedy self from building self — they can coexist

> "I think you think you have to be in two separate buckets when you can kind of mesh the two."

### 5. VA/Editor Pipeline
Brian has deep experience hiring VAs (worked at an agency that placed them). Offered to:
- Share when he finds a good short-form editor
- Send you raw videos to test editors
- Help you build the editing pipeline

This is valuable for scaling your content.

### 6. His Background (Useful Context)
- 3 years at online marketing company (called it "MBA in online marketing")
- Helped people hire VAs from Philippines
- Worked at video editing agency (editors from Nigeria, $300/mo)
- Currently building his own thing, uses Notion heavily
- Big Derek Sivers fan (hence Bear Blog interest)

## Product Ideas That Emerged

### 1. "Build Your Digital Home" Service
**What:** Help people set up Obsidian → Hugo → Netlify publishing flow
**Who:** Creators stuck in Substack/Medium who want independence
**Price:** $200-500 for done-with-you setup

### 2. Obsidian Migration Package
**What:** Port Notion to Obsidian + set up publishing
**Who:** Notion power users who want markdown ownership
**Price:** Could be add-on or standalone

### 3. POSSE Setup
**What:** Full "publish on your own site, syndicate everywhere" infrastructure
**Who:** Serious creators who get the long-term value
**Price:** Premium tier

## Quotable Moments

On the central tension:
> "I can't be both things... for a long time it was like, I don't have a creative side. Then I became very creative, and now I'm like, I can't do anything real, businessy. Because then I'm not my creative, comedic self-deprecating idiot."

On your advantage:
> "I think I'm good at understanding how to speak to coders, and thus I know how to speak to Claude Code... I just knew how to use Google before everybody else."

On the product gap:
> "Every time I've tried to transition, there's way more that goes into this than I thought."

**Brian:** When I first joined Sublime, I came to some of the Sublime calls because I'm a dude. For me, I think I have too many. Subscriptions to too many things. I think I still even have my Sublime subscription, but I'm just so deeply embedded into notion that it was so hard to transition.

**Alex:** Yeah, I think that's Sublime main hurdle. You can't switch everything over. I mean, I've been pretty much with them anymore on a day to day I'm involved, but I don't really do a whole lot.

**Brian:** Yeah. Okay?

**Alex:** So I get the emails, I follow them, but I haven't been that involved in the day to day.

**Brian:** Did you want to. Okay, I guess let's go with. What is your goal right now? Do you want. You're trying to, like, Are you trying to do something with the coding thing that you launched? Or do you not know?

**Alex:** Great questions. Great questions. Man, I don't know. I'll tell you what I'm thinking, which is. Like what I wanted for a while is to make money writing. And doing my own writing, both are true, et cetera. And I think that's just like, it's not impossible, and I think I'm on the path. But it's hard. It's hard and.

**Brian:** Do you mind telling me how much that brings you a month?

**Alex:** Yeah. A month is about a 1, 200. It's about 12 grand a year. Right. So it's a good amount of money. It's not nothing. It's the most I've ever. Totally. And also just like, as an artist, period, I'm making money on my art. That's insane. To think about to conceive of that.

**Brian:** Okay? If you're a single guy if you're a single guy living. Yeah. Yeah.

**Alex:** It's the most I've ever made on my own stuff, and so it's really cool. Hold on. I'm just going to hide myself. View. I can't look at myself here. It's really cool. But it's not enough. What I think I would have to do to get it there. Feels like it would stuck the living soul out of the creative thing that it is. And I've been kind of trying and it doesn't really even work. I'm not that good at it, trying to do co writing and stuff. I'm just like God, I don't know. I don't know.

**Brian:** Yeah. Have you? And I think. I think just having a conversation and kind of like. Yeah. Talking about this stuff, but I have so much experience helping people with, like, community building and stuff like that. So let's just go through what you've tried.

**Alex:** Yeah. Yeah, man.

**Brian:** Sessions. But did you ever do kind of like more of an open format? How many, how many paid subs do you have that would show up to the. To the calls usually?

**Alex:** Okay, so I'll give you all the deets. If this is your world, I'm happy to. I mean, basically I was doing. It was called the Batcave and I was doing co writing sessions twice a week. Two hours each time. Usually I would do, like, a little, like, I would. I called it like a stand up routine at the beginning, but with actual good advice. But it was kind of like these deranged power points. They were really fun, but they were, like, to an audience of, you know, three to seven people, sometimes up. To, like, 10. But that was usually the people who attended it. It was like, between three on a small day, 12 to 15 on a good day. On a really, really good day, usually around like, 5 to 8. You know, I think the price was weird because it was like 8 bucks a month or 70 for a year, which. Feels, like, way too low for kind of what it is, but also not. I don't know. Yeah, so the price was weird. And then I also I did a thing where I did a workshop that I priced I did it only for paying bat Both our true yeah. To answer your question, I have about.

**Brian:** Subscribers of those two separate things.

**Alex:** Three. Say that again.

**Brian:** This bat cave and paying subscribers? That's one and the same.

**Alex:** It's one and the same, but. And I did a survey on this, like most of the people who pay for both are true. Don't care about Bat Cave. They just want to support me. You know what I mean? Like, they just like me, and they're like, oh, this is cool. But I think it got some new people to subscribe and pay, and. And there's a lot of people who are, like, definitely interested in it and who are like, dude, I love what you're doing with the, you know, it's like there's awareness about it, but not a ton of people actually coming because it's a big ask, you know, and, but, but total paying subscribers. I think there's like 230 or so for both our true period.

**Brian:** Got it. Got it. Right. Right.

**Alex:** And then I did a workshop that was that only. I only told paying both our true people about it. And it was like a beta test. It was called, like, how to Write Vulnerably and Come Meet how to Write Vulnerable and Comedy. How to do both by doing neither is kind of like the vibe of it. And it was like a two hour session with, like, writing before and after two hour sessions, so six hours total. And I did it at, like, I did it at a fake price of $299,000, just kind of as a joke. But that was like the price on stripe. And then you could put in a discount code to bring the price down to $99. So it was $99. And 10 people like it. It sold out, basically. 10 people paid for it, which was cool, you know, And I did that, and it was really. Yeah, yeah, it was awesome. And I think people got a lot out of it. I mean, it. Was my first one I've ever done. I'm kind of, like, manic during them and pretty insane, but. But it was really fun, and I think people dug it. I like doing it. I think I just get really anxious after with, like, did people like it? Would people pay more? You know, all that bullshit, but.

**Brian:** It was just a one time. It was just one long call.

**Alex:** Yeah, I did it. It was, it was. I did. Basically, I'll send you kind of what I pitched, but there was two hours co writing session before the event where we would get together and just kind of like jam and write and talk. Then the two hour event and then two hour co writing after, like each spread. A week apart where you could, like, kind of try out some of the things that we were learning in the. You know, on your own. And I gave people. I also included a free editing session of, like, I would edit their stuff, but most people didn't even take me up on that, which is weird.

**Brian:** Wow. I'm surprised. One of the things that came to my mind was I thought something that would be that people that read you would be interested in is like. Like, almost like roast my essay type thing, you know?

**Alex:** Totally, totally. And I think some. So like the other, I'm. I'm very. I mean you read my stuff so you know, self loathing. But there is also a lot of success in everything I've been doing in that like all of the. I also have all my client work and all of that Sublime. Came from both our true, all of my current clients. All of that has come from both our true in one way or another, right? Where I'm like, I'm helping people brand, I'm helping brands with voice copy, all of these, like, kind of creative writing things and helping. I don't know. There is one person right now who pays me. He pays me 1,200 bucks a month.

**Brian:** Yeah.

**Alex:** For two calls a month. Where we work on his memoir, which is, like, pretty sick. I kind of couldn't believe that he said yes to that. And, like, you know what I mean? Like, and. And I give him feedback on his writing. Same. Same kind of thing. But that came through. Both are true. Where he was like, you know, and I so. Anyways, that's all the writing stuff. And then. And then this coding stuff. Which.

**Brian:** You're doing. Okay, so when you put that gumroad thing, like, hey, guys, just launch this, like, silly thing, I was just like, What he's doing. That came out of nowhere. And I feel like you don't. Yeah, I guess. Another thing that I was surprised by was the thing you shared, like, a few weeks back in the pathos community that I think you said, does it live on a website by itself and it's just, like, notes and stuff?

**Alex:** Oh, yeah. Life is a crying baby. Yeah, the little, like, zine thing I did. Yeah. Yeah.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Alex:** Yeah.

**Brian:** I mean, yeah, the coding stuff. Like, what do you want to do with that? Do you want to turn it into something? Do you. Did you start doing that just out of self interest? Because I think you can package that up. I mean, look at the interest you got from Twitter.

**Alex:** Totally. No, I mean. My. I've always been interested in that stuff and, like, pretty good at it in that, like. I don't know. I just. I think I'm good at understanding how to speak to coders, and thus I know how to speak to Claude code. You know, I remember when I was, like, 18, 19. I had a theory that, like, the reason why I was smart or considered smart was because I was good at Google before everybody else was. You know, like, really, like. And I think that's true. Like, I really believe that, like, I just knew how to use.

**Brian:** Good at prompt engineering and asking.

**Alex:** Basically just, like, knowing what you can get back from it if you, like, tweak the dials a little bit. And I think this is the same thing. I think, like, because I have, like, colleagues that I've, like, watched them use it, and I'm like, just ask it what you need. And they're like, I don't know. I'm like. Just that, you know, so there's something like. Anyways. I really like doing all of it, and it genuinely helps me a lot with, like, my ADHD stuff and all of this other stuff. And I have. My thesis is that, like, a lot of people want to learn how to do it, you know, right now. And there is. And I didn't even realize that, like, it was having a moment on Twitter the way it is, but, like, it seems like it's blowing the up. And I do think that is something I think people would pay a lot of money for because there's just, like, a ton of value in it.

**Brian:** Yes.

**Alex:** In a way that they wouldn't pay to support a writer. You know, like, it's. There's a lot more self interest, I think. I don't know exactly what to do. I have ideas. But, yeah, that's where I'm at.

**Brian:** Okay? I mean, okay, so step by step, what have you done? What have you. Have you started taking at least some sort of. Anybody that took a positive. Anybody that. That gave a positive reply. To being interested in it.

**Alex:** Yeah.

**Brian:** Either running them through some sort of, like. Type form and then to booking a call or something. I mean, no, because you don't want to get on calls. You just want to be able to sell it by itself. But you said you took the price from Grum Road, you made it free.

**Alex:** Yeah, I switched it to free. And I got, like. I don't know, I've gotten, like, 10 downloads. One person paid 20 bucks. Someone last night paid $99, which is cool. And then I did put a form, a tally form, on the tweet, and I've been putting that in places, and as of now, 56 people. Have signed up for that.

**Brian:** So the tally form just has the people, but they haven't been directed to the Gumroad only. Only a limited people. Only a limited number of people know that the free download is already up on gumroad, right? Like you have.

**Alex:** Yeah. Yeah. Because the thing on Gumroad is, like. It's not the best thing, I think, because it's like, it's. It's like a ship. The vibe product, that's like a vibe coach. But it's not like, the big thing. I think I could sell people.

**Brian:** N't.

**Alex:** You know, which is more. Which I need to kind of figure out. Like, that's why I was excited to talk to you, too, and, like, learn. I still am, like, in the learning phase of, like, what do people want? Because then I can build it. But then I did. Paul recommended this? I did. I set up a Cal.com link for people to book calls with me for 50 bucks per call. And I only have four slots. Two people already did it, so there's only two left. So it's like, all right, I made, like, 220 bucks. You know, it's pretty sick.

**Brian:** Got it. Yeah.

**Alex:** But that's where it's all at. And the other thing I think, I mean, I'm curious what you think is, like, I feel like the place I could really, like, blow this up is substack, because nobody, like, Twitter is saturated, right? Like, everybody on Twitter. Is, like, psychotic about this stuff. It's hard. I'm. I'm. I got lucky that that thing went viral, but, like, on Substack, that's where the creatives are that I think, like, that there's a large percentage of people who all read Sublime, who all are like, read Lenny or. Whatever. Who, like, that's the audience. Because I think the, the, the package or the thesis or the vibe of it is like Claude code for creatives, right? Or like Claude code for non coders. It's like that's the, that's the solve, that's the problem. I think I'm. Solving for people. So I want to, like, start doing that. But, like, not on both are true, but, like, probably a separate thing. Because I want to keep them separate, I think. But I don't know. What do you think? You seem smart about this stuff. What's your brain saying?

**Brian:** You're going to be going completely more into. I think it should be two separate things, too, like.

**Alex:** Yeah.

**Brian:** I think both is true. I see that as almost like a mem. Like a memoir, like a living memoir, like a state of just what's going on in your personal life. And it's just you have, you know, literally hundreds of people that are willing to pay money just because they enjoy that entertainment factor.

**Alex:** Yeah. Totally.

**Brian:** You know, and then having the separate people subscribe.

**Alex:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Brian:** But then, you know, they still follow you as a creator because I think a lot of people now are following people on Substack too. And then subscribe, either one or the other, because people are getting overloaded with emails nowadays.

**Alex:** Sorrow. Ing. Totally, totally.

**Brian:** Man, you're getting some good traction. So what have you built for yourself? And then I guess I would tell you I was trying to just scroll back on WhatsApp, but I don't have that list that you listed out. You listed out, like, remember text? And you were like, hey, guys, I did all this. Stuff. Who needs help. I was like, damn, there are a couple things in there I remember that like stuck out to me, but I can't remember if you put it in the self promotion links or if you put it in the path. Okay, no. Actually got it.

**Alex:** Self promotion, but I can. Let me pull it up.

**Brian:** Okay, I got it. Here. I just shared this to Ben thing I actually want to sell. Cloud code for creatives. It basically helps you set up Claude code as the HQ for a whole creative life. Your ideas, project client stuff. Yeah. So. An invoicing tool for client an email drip campaign.

**Alex:** Yeah, the zine.

**Brian:** So the blog that publishes straight from your writing folder. What is that?

**Alex:** Yeah. I mean, so let me show you.

**Brian:** Like I could literally take things from my notion. That, like, ideas that I have, and then. And then there's something that just takes it and puts it automatically in the substack.

**Alex:** It wouldn't be in substack. So I have this set up on. Why is this being so weird? Open the settings. Hold on.

**Brian:** Oh, both are true. Is your where's this hosted?

**Alex:** Both our True.com, which is a separate. Which is separate. It's my.

**Brian:** Dude, how did you get that domain?

**Alex:** Own. I bought it a long time ago. When I made the substack.

**Brian:** I'm surprised. It was like.

**Alex:** Yeah, dude. You think so if you go there. That's my. That's my blog. And that I created as a way to. Because I was just like, I don't know what's going on with substack, you know, Like, I don't want to be beholden to.

**Brian:** Posse.

**Alex:** Say that again.

**Brian:** Have you heard of posse p o s s e?

**Alex:** No. What's that?

**Brian:** Okay, so I'm so happy we're talking about this, because this is something that's very top of mind for me right now.

**Alex:** Okay? Awesome.

**Brian:** Paul and I were talking about this. I'm going to share my screen with you real quick.

**Alex:** The positive foundation. No. Yes.

**Brian:** So it's basically, it stands for publish on your own site syndicate.

**Alex:** Wait. Let me open the. Hold on. Now. This is sick.

**Brian:** So it's like your site should be thing and then it goes everywhere else, not the other way.

**Alex:** Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.

**Brian:** And this thing that I have dropped the ball on so bad because I just literally. I was one of those people that, like, you know, wanted to start blogging. Back in the day when I was reading Mark Manson, you know, like 10 years ago, when I was dreading my corporate job, I wanted to, like, start blogging. Because I was reading all the old bloggers, and then it just. I remember I bought a domain and I was like, damn, there's way more that goes into this than I thought. Never follow through with it. And then, you know, a few years ago, I think exactly around three years ago, when I. When I. And I think I told you this in the chat one time, too, like, there was a few people I discovered on Substack, and I was like, damn, finally a platform that I could just sign. Up for and start blogging. I don't have to, like, build a website and buy a domain and everything. And then. So that's why I started doing it. But then now I know I need my own site so I can do this stuff. But I still, I'm like, I just bought the domain a new domain, like, two weeks ago. So I'm, like, in the process of doing what you have here.

**Alex:** Yeah. I mean. Let me show you. Like how mine works. I might need to jump back in here in a different browser. Hold on. Because Chrome is acting like a little bit. Ch. One. Second. Okay? I'll be right back.

**Brian:** You did.

**Alex:** Yo. Okay? Let me see here. All right. Okay. Can you see this? Okay, so I. I don't know how easy this is with Notion, because Notion. I don't think Notion just has, like, markdown files on your computer.

**Brian:** I see her.

**Alex:** But obsidian does. So obsidian.

**Brian:** Just listen to a dialectic podcast with the Acidium founder, and I was like, dan, this guy's cool. I need to. I wish. I wish I would have started on Obsidian.

**Alex:** Cool as hell. I mean, you can probably. I'm sure there's an easy. Especially with Claude code. Speaking of like, you could port it over really easily. Because Obsidian has property. Like the database stuff. It has. But the beauty of Obsidian and really all of this stuff, Claude code, is that everything is just a file on your computer. It's very much aligned with that publish on your own. You know, it's like you own the markdown files.

**Brian:** Right. Right.

**Alex:** So if I was like, hi, Brian, and this was. If this works. If I took this. I have a folder called Ready to Publish. If I put it in here? And then I have to. I. I have this set up. Where if I type in the word glob, it, like auto runs a little script. Let's see if it works. Yeah. So see. Hi, brian. Found file a publish hit. Yes. Cool. So this is going to pop. I mean, I had to set this up like this is. It's not like this took zero time. But I have my site on netlify. And now let's see. Ideally, this would push. Yeah. Bam. So there it is. And it was that.

**Brian:** That's so cool.

**Alex:** Yeah, it's pretty sick. I mean. Yeah. Yeah. And then I have, like.

**Brian:** Wow.

**Alex:** I have my.

**Brian:** It's already. There.

**Alex:** Say that again.

**Brian:** I just refreshed on mine, and it's already there.

**Alex:** Yeah. Yeah. I mean. So what's happening under the hood there is, like, I have a script that I've created with Claude code that it's published to blog script. It's really easy because of this is all a Hugo paper mod thing. But again, like, I don't know, like that's the weird thing about Claude code is like, I don't really know how any of this works, you know? Like, I just know enough to know how to make Claude code, make it work.

**Brian:** But you're signed up. You were Hugo. Okay, so I've heard of Hugo before. Isn't that the web. Isn't that the web hosting.

**Alex:** No, Hugo is just like a framework. For making a website. So it's like. It's just like a way of using code the same way I think Java is. I don't know if it's it's not a language, it's a framework that people use and build upon. It's a static site generator, so it's like you can run some Hugo stuff to make a website look the way that mine does with this paper mod. I think Papermod is a theme that Hugo uses, but Netlify is where I host the site, so I bought it on Namecheap, but it doesn't matter. But I connected it all to netlify. So my site lives on netlify, and when I run my script, it pushes to get Hub and then pushes to netlify. So you saw Waiting for netlify deployment that runs on netlify. But all of this I did inside of Claude code using netlify's API. Which, again, like, I don't know how it works, but I know enough to know how to make it work, you know what I mean?

**Brian:** Well.

**Alex:** This is a thing I could do for people, right? Like, I could. I could set this up for you if you wanted. Pretty easily, probably. I don't know if that's, like, something. So that's one thing, right? That's like, one.

**Brian:** I. Think that's. I think that's super cool. I think that's super cool because personally, so the reason I've heard of Hugo now before. It's all coming. It's all just. You just tied some things together for me. I came across, I think, after I heard that Obsidian podcast episode and. I was looking into it, I came across some guy randomly who is building something called Practical Hugo. And he basically teaches you, you know, how to build static websites with YouGo and stuff like that. But I'm getting more and more into this. Like, I realize the importance of everything we talked about before, of the posse, of having your own thing, because we don't know what is going to be the next social media, that we don't know what the next substack is going to be. So it's like. I think it's really cool when you see. Even sometimes you'll see, like, you know how an article will go viral, and sometimes it will get published in multiple places, but then at the bottom it will say, like, the original posting is here on my website. And it's like, then you go. You're like, damn, this person's really cool, you know, so.

**Alex:** Yeah. And, I mean, that's like. It sounds like you're the same. The people I most admire on the Internet are not on Substack. They're the old, old head bloggers, then. They're. They have. They always have their own shit.

**Brian:** Right. Right. Right.

**Alex:** I read them through an rss reader. Like, my. My. Another thesis I have is like, I want to be around longer than substack, you know, period.

**Brian:** Right. Right.

**Alex:** Like, I don't. The way that they've been doing there, I don't know how long it's going to last, you know, and it's an amazing avenue for me because I have some good real estate on there, basically, you know, like, I grow through there.

**Brian:** Right.

**Alex:** But now it's the same way that I grow on Twitter or any of these. It's. It's like a truly social platform more than anything else, is kind of how I think about it. I think how I'm changing my thinking about it.

**Brian:** I think the first thing that comes to my mind is, like, helping for you. Like, kind of like the. Yeah, you. You had. You already came up with that one. Name of the. What was it? Ship it.

**Alex:** Ship the vibe.

**Brian:** But also kind of just another tagline or kind of thing to call it is like helping people build their digital identity. And like, yes, like, sober and all the other things I personally do, and I spent so much fucking time.

**Alex:** They're hum their digital home.

**Brian:** Trying to decide which, like, you know, where should I buy the domain? Because there's 10 different places I could buy the domain. Where should. This is the first. Even with all the research I've done, it's the first time I've heard of the site that you use. Was it netaflight? What? Was it called?

**Alex:** Netlify yeah.

**Brian:** Have you heard of bear blog? That's what I was gonna. That's what I started using. Just because Derek Sivers recommends it. And I'm a big fan of Derek Sivers.

**Alex:** I love him. Yeah.

**Brian:** So that's where I kind of, like, registered everything, and that's where I was going to start doing my own digital home. But, yeah, man, I think just helping people with that is just figuring out how to package it up. So I think for you, You could have basically two things. You could have a do it yourself that people pay. You know, it basically sits on gumroad, and it's like you could literally plug it at the bottom of every single one of your newsletters, like, hey, want to build your digital home? I have this DIY thing that sits on gum road. You know, you could price it between 25 to 50 bucks. I think that's a reasonable price that people are willing to pay. And then you have a premium service where if people want, like, where you jump on a call and actually do it together. You charge like more for that? Where it's like, hey, we're going to. But it's not a one time session. It's like we work together for a month.

**Alex:** Right. Right.

**Brian:** To build your digital home or to, you know, do whatever you want to do on the Internet. That part we still need to refine. It's kind of like the solid menu almost of what they can do with you.

**Alex:** Because I think a lot of people would just want me to do it for them, or, like, you know, they'd want to just be like, can you just do it? You know?

**Brian:** But also watching you. Because I wouldn't want it just done for me without me knowing what's going on. Questions and, like, you know what I mean? Like, understand it so I could. So I could use it once I don't have you anymore.

**Alex:** Right, right, right, right. So, like. Yeah. So what do you feel like you would ideally want? You know, because we could do it as, like, a test, and I could do it for free, you know, just for fun. Because it sounds like you can help me with all this other, like, marketing. I want to hear about the Instagram. Stuff, too. But, yeah, I'm curious. What would you ideally want? You don't have to answer now, too. You can think about it.

**Brian:** It's helped setting this up so that I know how to. Publish to it quickly and help with Obsidian and linking Obsidian to my website. Like, because I. I'm so new to. I'm about to be. If I do make the transition to Obsidian, I'm going to be so new to it and like, I already and everything, but it's just. Like, I'm. I'm not. I don't want to watch YouTube videos and tutorials, you know what I mean?

**Alex:** Because what's your current setup? It's all notion, all the time.

**Brian:** Everything in notion. All like my ideas for blog post essays and just like where I brain dumb quotes and everything. And yeah, if I could get that. And then. So whenever I'm writing an article, I'll just jump into Notion and search the folder of what I'm writing about and then go into that folder and then I'll just manually open up substack in another window and I'll take from notion and put them into the substack essay.

**Alex:** Do you want, like.

**Brian:** But I. Guess this still doesn't seem like what you're doing because you still have to write out everything for when you write your Both are true. Essays on substack. You still have to manually do all that, right?

**Alex:** Yeah. And I want. I mean. The way my flow for that right now is I record it all on voice. Just these long. I call them voice.

**Brian:** Is that what you do?

**Alex:** Not like not not off all the time with these essays, but more and more I'll just like. I call them voice vomits where I'll just like, talk out a story. It's usually at like 5 in the morning. And then I kind of just have Claude. Clean it up. But then I have to clean that up a lot, and so it's still. It's still a ton of work. But it. But it does. It is my new way of kind of getting everything out. And then I actually use Super Whisper. Have you heard of that?

**Brian:** It's probably the same as Whisper Flow, right?

**Alex:** Yeah, it's a little more. Hackery than Whisper.

**Brian:** Just talking into it, and then it transcribes.

**Alex:** Well, that's the thing is. I'll show you. It's a little more. It's. It's what happens after you talk. Where? I have a. Where is it? So you can see. Okay, cool. So I have something called Diane, which is from. I stole it from this other guy, Matt Webb, but it's from fucking Twin Peaks, where, like, you say, hi, Diane, or whatever, and basically what happens is it takes your voice note. And turns it into a markdown document that then I just paste right into Obsidian with this format. So basically, in Obsidian, let me see.

**Brian:** In a subsidiary where you do all your brain dumping and stuff like that, like.

**Alex:** Yeah. Yeah. So like voice. Yeah. So it's like V1. Diane. Like Diane. This is the Diane version. So this is. This is the brain dump. Okay?

**Brian:** Got it.

**Alex:** And then this is the version from Diane, which is like, you know, just turning it into paragraphs. There's some hashtags. I don't really use those, but it's nice to have them. And I say literally in the voice note, like, Diane, one thing. I want you to create a note that's just here's a list of things active right now. And then it should have made its own note for this, which because anything can be. I mean, notion maybe is like this too. It's like Rome research where like, anything can become a note. Right. So then this is now its own note. It's kind of like, yeah, the power of Rome finally all makes sense. But I don't use this even a ton now because of Claude code, where I have. I run a lot of this all through Claude code, but. But, yeah, so basically, like, going from this.

**Brian:** Right.

**Alex:** Big block of vomit to this. So that I have this, you know, is like the script that I wrote.

**Brian:** Wow.

**Alex:** In diane mode in super whisper. I don't always use that. But. Yeah.

**Brian:** I wonder if they have modes inside of Whisper Flow.

**Alex:** They probably do. I just didn't. I don't know, I didn't love it as much for some reason. It felt a little too, like. Yeah, it just felt a little. It's like a little too sass consumery for me, where it felt like. Where it was like it didn't want. Me to do the hacking. You know, like, I want to be able to do my own. I want to be able to, like, hack stuff. And some apps are, like, much more down with that and then others are not. Where others are like, no, we do it all for you, you know, And I think a lot of people want that, but for me, like, I wanted to kind of be ahead. It's like, I. I've been wanting to do things that the tools don't yet do, and the ability to, like, just literally give it a prompt. That it can then act on. And then change that whenever I want. I mean, maybe Whisper Flow has that too. I don't know. I haven't used it a ton. The idea holds right is like that elevating an assisted coding through prompts. Yeah, I don't know. Enhancing cursor workflows with whisper flow.

**Brian:** How long have you had the separate the both are true domain and publishing stuff on there and I guess you put the stuff you publish on there. Like what is an editor anyways? ChatGPT said like none of those are published on substack. Those are just completely.

**Alex:** Yeah, I've had it. I mean, I've been. I've been really actively doing it. I'd say, I don't know, we could. You could find a first date of the post, but probably like, three, four months. And it's really. It's still a secret. Like, I haven't. I haven't announced it or anything because I kind of like people not knowing about it, you know? Like, I kind of. Because it's like a sort of antidote to substack, where it's like I post and everybody. It's like I just have to go through the, like, the. The kind of birthing process afterwards of like, oh, God, it's out. And do people hate it? And it's like, these are just, like. It just feels like blogging. I'm just like, it's done.

**Brian:** Okay?

**Alex:** You know, Whereas substech is like, what's my strategy for this pose? It's just like. It's all such bullshit, you know? And it just doesn't feel as fun anymore because it's become big. It's like this big thing. And I'm grateful for that. Blah, blah, blah. But also, like, I just want to have my own little home, you know? My own little fun, weird place that's like.

**Brian:** Yeah.

**Alex:** Yeah.

**Brian:** I think you should start. I think you should start this separate. Like substack and start. Or. And. And start talking about this stuff. Because, man, I think it's really, really interesting, and I think a lot of people are going to want it, and I'll still need to think about how you can. How you can productize it, but. I think a lot of people would want something like this.

**Alex:** Totaling. I mean, it's. It's. I love talking to you about it because it's like I forget that all of this stuff. Is even around in, like, what I've done. It's like I forget quickly. What it is that I've been doing, you know, and there's value to it. So this is helpful.

**Brian:** I mean, I'm sure there was a lot of people that wanted start blogging just like me, but literally Substack and Medium, where the. Finally, the first entry points to where they didn't have to, like, set all this up, you know?

**Alex:** Totally, totally, totally, totally.

**Brian:** But now code and with everything is becoming much easier to set up your own home.

**Alex:** Yeah. I mean, that's what it was really hard. To set up the zine thing, right? Because that involved emailing people. And so I had to. Sorry.

**Brian:** Wow. What did you have to.

**Alex:** Because so the way that that thing worked was you signed up for it. And then I would email you each one of the 30 or the. I don't know, I forget how many, like, 50 entries. Over the course of a month. Outside of substack all through the bothartrue.com domain. And so I ended up using another service for that called Loops. And I had to basically kind of, like, build my own little substack that sends these emails. It's like Beehive or a lot of these others, but I had to kind of, like, do that on my own. And that was pretty hard. It's hard to, like, create your own little newsletter without the help of Substack, Right? But I think that's a future we're also going toward. Is like, there's another company called Resend. I tried both of them and got pretty far with Resend, too. Where it's like it's going to be easier and easier to kind of like, run it yourself, where you can use one of these platforms to send emails without needing. Because I was using ConvertKit for a little bit. Which I fucking hate. Do you use them?

**Brian:** Oh, God. I use it for client work, and it's just like, so I do.

**Alex:** Dude. I never hated a company more. Honestly, Like, I really like. Like, I loathe them, you know, because it feels like I'm in a different decade of the Internet.

**Brian:** Salesy or clunky?

**Alex:** Clunky. Everything on it is like. I'm like, what? And male. It's like mailchimp. And I use mailchimp with a client, and I'm just like, this is crazy. Whereas, like, loops resend. They feel like very, like modern. Apps, like, built by developers for developers. But it's like, that's the thing. I think everybody is now a developer with Claude code. I don't know. I was just so nice to use a tool where I'm like, oh, this tool, like, gets me. Like, I feel like I can be in flow with it versus ConvertKit, where I'm just like, these people. And the pricing is bullshit. Like, you have to pay more to get certain analytics. I'm like, dude, this sucks.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Alex:** Anyways.

**Brian:** And what are you publishing on the other? Remind me again the name of the third site. There's. Both are true. There's a substack. And then what's the other thing?

**Alex:** With the zine.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. What's it called?

**Alex:** So that's just like a project. It's called Life is a Crying Baby. The idea was, it was a month's worth of my notes in Obsidian that I was like, I'm going to send these to people as, like, a diary of my thoughts. And you get them in the same cadence as how I wrote them. So in that month, if I wrote four in the first day, which I think I did, the day you sign up for it, you'll get those four on the first day. I didn't write anything the second day. You won't get anything on the second day. The third day I wrote one. You get one, right? And so.

**Brian:** And that was you wanted people to sign up for separately.

**Alex:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Brian:** Why? What was the purpose of that? That seems completely random.

**Alex:** It was. It was largely to teach myself everything that I just told you about how to use loops and how to build that stuff.

**Brian:** Got it.

**Alex:** Because I thought it'd be really fun to build, like, a tool where you don't know when the next email is coming. But I've already scheduled all 55 of them or whatever, you know, so, like. So there's like, 100 people, I think, that signed up for that.

**Brian:** It's basically like the same as what somebody has when. When it's a. It's a cooler, more creative developer, like, basically welcome sequence.

**Alex:** Exactly. Exactly.

**Brian:** When somebody. Like when somebody opts into your thing, you're just sending them 50 pieces of mail, spread out sporadically, telling them about who you are, what you do and what you're interested in.

**Alex:** Yeah, except they're, like, really deranged emails that are in my. I'll show you. And it was a test of whether I could create that. That was actually the big test was whether I could create whether I could take markdown files from Obsidian and create emails from in the format that this Loops thing needed, such that I didn't have to do any work. And the answer is, like, I basically could. Yeah, so I basically figured that out. Let me show you, though. It is pretty sick. I like talking to you because I'm like, oh, yeah, this is kind of cool what I did. Like, I really don't. I, like, forgot. Hold. On. So. So, like. So this is the site, right? And, you know, it's like 57 notes. November. I wrote down all my thoughts. This is all of them. You put your email in, sign me up. You get them at the same cadence, and then this is what it looks like on the back end. Life is a crime, baby. Contact added. Send email. So, you know, it's like this email. Two minutes later, next email, zero, delay the next email. Because that's cadence. Wait, like, however long this is, send the next one right. You can see people are unsubscribing. You know, like, obviously, because it's like, what the fuck? The fuck is happening? Like, day two of not smoking weed. Right? It's like. It's like truly, like, some of them literally have, like, only a few words in them. He was great. This is a quote.

**Brian:** Like to set godin style. Daily blog.

**Alex:** Yeah, but, like, some of them literally don't even have a full thought in them. This one might rebrand as Sash. Sash. Or maybe this release goes out as Sash. That's it. And then I did add an editor's note, which is like, you know, whatever, but. So that's that. 's. Yeah, like.

**Brian:** So this was just thing to see if you could basically take stuff from the city and build this flow. It wasn't so much to like, it wasn't for a specific outcome.

**Alex:** It was also a. Creatively, I think, important for me to, like, get this stuff out because there was a. There's like. This was a dark period. I, like, started smoking weed again and then stopped. And I was trying to, I guess, process that, you know, and, like, write about it, but I didn't want to. Write a big thing about it, and so this was kind of a way to do that too.

**Brian:** Got it. Okay, so talk to me. About what? There's somebody I came across that I wanted to show you because I think this is, like. I think this is the one thing that you could adjust in your Instagram that would just make it.

**Alex:** Yeah.

**Brian:** So much better. But I don't know, are you into, like. Because I feel like you're good on camera. Like, your camera presence is great, you know? Like, and you're not, like, afraid of, like, pressing, recording and talking and just going ad.

**Alex:** Not at all.

**Brian:** And. But I just think the. The thing you're missing is, like, having some.

**Alex:** I mean, that's where I started was, like, doing comedy videos, you know?

**Brian:** Dude, you just need to have like. Like, this guy's a programmer, but he also makes kind of, like, funny videos. And he, like, lives in Bali and, you know, or I think he lives in New York, but then he does Stinton Bali, and he just, like, the big thing that you're missing is so that. When people land on your page. Tell the what are the videos going to tell me? You know what I mean? And when they land on your page, have any insight into what video is going to have what in it? I think nowadays having that kind of like, you know, how when you post a reel, you have like, the real.

**Alex:** The thumbnail.

**Brian:** Thumbnail of the. Really? Yeah. Yeah. There's a reason. There's. There's a reason. Literally, people have businesses built on just showing people how to do YouTube thumbnails. Because the pack. People won't open it unless they. Unless the packaging is good.

**Alex:** But what is my. That's the thing is, like, I. I think I'm like, I don't know what the package is. Who am I? You know, like, am I like this? Because, like. I do comedy stuff. But then the stuff, all the stuff we just talked about was not comedy stuff at all, really, though. I could talk about it in a funny way, but it's not, like, weird satirical stuff. I don't know. It's like, I don't know how to. Take myself seriously enough. Without making fun of it all. I don't know. Do you know what I mean?

**Brian:** Do you know this guy?

**Alex:** I think I've seen him. Yeah, yeah.

**Brian:** I feel like he. I feel like you need to do a mix of his stuff. And, like. And, like, something more serious, where you do talk about, like, coding and programming and stuff like that, but through, like, a funny lens, you know? Look, I think all of your takes on how like social media, what it does to most people is, Is bad. But if you can use social media in a good way to find the others and meet cool people, like, that's what it's meant to be used for. But when you let it consume, when you fall into these conspiracy theories, like, that's where it gets. But I think you can do a funny, humorous take on. On the whole landscape of social media and then just also talk about how you're helping people build digital homes. Off of the social media platforms.

**Alex:** Right.

**Brian:** Kind of how you tie it, tie the two together.

**Alex:** Right. Right.

**Brian:** I think you're putting I think you think that you have to be in these two separate buckets when, when, when, when you can kind of mesh the two, they demand. There's this other guy following who has just been crushing reels lately. When I'll send it to you on Instagram when I find him. But he's like a musician. But he's talking about everything that's going on in America that's fucked up right now. But he's a musician, and that's his thing.

**Alex:** Right. You just got to kind. Of right. I mean, that's the sort of the central tension of my life. Which is funny because I write both are true, but is like this thing of, like, combined of. Of like. I can't be both things. I can't be my. You know, like, for a long time, it was like, I don't have a creative side. I can't be creative because I'm doing all the business stuff. Then I became very creative, and now I'm like, I can't, like, do anything real, you know, like businessy. Because then I'm not my creative, comedic self deprecating idiot, you know? And I know, like, I should just put that on an Instagram reel, you know? Like, that's like, I help fucking other people with this where, like, they literally say that to me and I'm like, that's what. You should talk about.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Alex:** You know, but it's like, it's so hard to do for yourself. But yeah. Yeah.

**Brian:** Yeah. I think on some of your videos you could just rant. And that ranting is good, but let's make that ranting a little bit more directed. You know, towards what? You know what I mean?

**Alex:** Right. Right, right, right, right. Do you think? Are you. Do you do a lot of YouTube stuff, too? Or are you. Are you mainly, like, you help people with Instagram?

**Brian:** No, I. So check this out. I also. So I know how important what we talked about earlier. Like, the whole packaging stuff and everything is so, like, when I originally started my YouTube, from the very beginning, I wanted to have, like, a very consistent brand, kind of like, you know, where I like, Where it looks professional, you know what I mean? I think.

**Alex:** Your Instagram does, too. Like. I feel like your shit looks really legit.

**Brian:** Yeah. And so I think that is just an important part of it. And so basically what I do. So to give you a little bit more context on, like, how why I have experience with this stuff is because I worked with. When I first quit my job and moved to Barcelona, I worked with one of those guys you see on Instagram that's like, hey, I'll help you. Are you? Are you stuck at 10k a month? We get you? We to 100k a month. You know what I mean? I worked with one of those guys for, like, three years. And it was a great experience because I learned everything about the online world in the space and marketing and funnels and everything, you know, And, I mean, it was like my crash course. It was like an NBA in online marketing. Getting paid. It was good. And one of our main things that we did was we helped people hire virtual assistants from the Philippines. And we got really.

**Alex:** Right. You mentioned this in Pathless Path. Yeah.

**Brian:** Good at teaching people how to vet because a lot of people will try a virtual assistant, and then they. And then they're like, they're disappointed because they tried one and that one didn't work out. But any company that hires 10 employees, there's only going to be two or three really good ones. You know, so it's like you have to come up with a good vetting process so you don't get burnt out just on the hiring process and then from there. Because I didn't want to do all the graphics and all the editing myself. I wanted. I wanted to just put my ideas out there. And then have someone else do all that stuff on the back end. So I've. I have, like, a girl who does some graphic design stuff for me, and whenever I have, like, a new YouTube video, I just send her, hey, here's the picture. Do the thumbnail. And she sends me a few options back.

**Alex:** Totaling, totaling.

**Brian:** And now what I'm trying to do is with my Instagram, too. I don't want to when I get stuck. When I get stuck into a video edit, that's when I just. The hours freaking fly by and I can spend so many times on a little stupid little detail and I'm like, damn it, this detail does not matter.

**Alex:** I know. I know.

**Brian:** So I'm. I'm in the process right now of finding, like, a short form editor to where I could just, like, send them stuff. And so if you want, when I find somebody, I'm just going to. I'll just hit you up and I'll be like, dude, Alex, send me over some. Raw videos and let's see what this guy can do. And I'm going to be doing the same with my stuff, too, is I just want to find somebody that could send raw videos to and then they come back to me prepackaged. And dude, one of these people. And another insight for you is,

**Alex:** Be amazing.

**Brian:** After I worked with that company for a little while, I worked with this other video agency where we did video editing for people. And, like, I just don't think people realize. I don't think people in the United States or people in, like, first world countries realize how, how much you can get good talent for overseas. You know what I mean? Like, we were. We were doing this video editing agency. Basically, their whole business model was they. They hired video editors from Nigeria for like 300 bucks a month. That was their 4 salary. And they were decent editors. They were pretty good. What they did was they split that editor between five different accounts and. You know, they sold to the people. What they sold to the clients was, hey, we're done for you video editing agency your raw files. And if you're on this plan, then you get a certain amount of hours per day. And if you're on the higher plan, then you get basically a full time video. Editor, but a lot of the accounts, they didn't have enough videos coming in for the editor to be full time, so they were always able to double dip with the editors between multiple accounts.

**Alex:** I mean, I think you're. Yeah, you're so spot. Because I've been trying to figure out the same thing, both for myself and for some of my clients. Where like. Like one of my main clients right now is a podcast, where it's a video podcast, and I'm, like, producing it. We take the long form, turn into short form. And right now.

**Brian:** And what are you right now, like descript or. Or opus? To cut.

**Alex:** I use Premiere Pro just because, like, I know that's what I like, that's what I. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Brian:** We know how to edit, actually. You have that being experience with, like, background, but it's just like every single video I want to, you know, I don't want.

**Alex:** Because. Exactly. Totally. And. And so, like, I've tried getting other people to do it, and the amount of back and forth afterwards. It feels like trying to get AI to do it where I'm like. It's just so I've. I've right now got it to where somebody's helping me put captions on it. And thumbnails.

**Brian:** To say, eye captions don't look good.

**Alex:** Now they. They suck. Like, even with cap cut, they have enough mistakes that fixing them takes too long.

**Brian:** And who's the person you got, and where did you get them from?

**Alex:** We were upwork. I final. I found one. I tried, like, six people. Five of them sucked, and one was good. You know, like. But, but. But it was to your point of like. That makes sense. Right? But it's hard.

**Brian:** Charge you on a per video or per hour? How does he charge?

**Alex:** For hour for hour. But he charged. It's all the company pays for it, so I don't even.

**Brian:** Okay?

**Alex:** At least I hope they will. I haven't really talked to him about it, but I need that from. But then I, like, tried this one guy for my own stuff, and I'll send you what he sent me back. It's like, fucking trash. I was like. He's like, I'll make you. I'll make you big on Instagram from your substacks. I was like, okay, cool. Give it a shot. And he sent me, like, the worst garbage. And so I was like, I don't know. So I'm. I'm with you on, like, finding actually good talent is very hard, but when you. When you do, it's great.

**Brian:** Yeah. And the example I always go back to is that that company that I worked for for three years, that, that first one, that first gross marketer guy. Man. He had this VA from the Philippines, Mel Jane. And I think. I'm sure she's probably still. She was just one of those rock star vas. And I've seen this with other companies that we placed VAs with when we found that VA would be there for, like, they were a lifer. You know what I mean?

**Alex:** Totally, totally.

**Brian:** Finding those cool, man. This was a great combo.

**Alex:** Yeah, let's keep jamming. Feel like.

**Brian:** I'll talk.

**Alex:** There's a lot to talk about, man. I'm glad we're doing it.

**Brian:** Cool, man. Have a good rest of the day. Talk soon. All right?

**Alex:** All right.
