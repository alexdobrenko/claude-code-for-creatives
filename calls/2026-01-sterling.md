**[Other]** Yo. 
**[You]** Hey, man, what's up? 
**[Other]** Hold on. Why can't I hear you? Can you hear me? 
**[You]** I can hear you. 
**[Other]** Okay, cool. So that's good. Let's just figure out output. 
**[You]** It might be on my end, too. 
**[Other]** Hold on one second. Not done yet. Has it worked? Calm. Every fucking platform has its own. 
**[You]** Wait. What about now? 
**[Other]** Now I can. Yeah. Good. 
**[You]** Yeah. That's on me. I think that was my fault. 
**[Other]** Okay. Nice to meet you. I have a parasocial relationship with you because. 
**[You]** You too. Well, happy to make it. Not parrot, just social. Now. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Get rid of the para. 
**[You]** The para. That's right. Where are you based? 
**[Other]** New york. How about you? 
**[You]** Nice. I'm in asheville, north carolina. 
**[Other]** Cool. Whoa. Do you know. Oh, my God. Of course I'm fucking having a brain fart. Oh, my. God. She just moved down. There. Oh, my. God. Stephanie. Oh, my. God. 
**[You]** I don't think so. 
**[Other]** You should know. Yeah, hold on. 
**[You]** Stephanie. 
**[Other]** Stephanie pereira. 
**[You]** Stephanie. What? 
**[Other]** Carrera. So she was. New ink at the new museum for a while. And she just moved down to Asheville. And she's super cool. Here, I'll send you. I'll give you the fucking LinkedIn. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** Stephanie pereira. There you go. Hold on. There you go. Here she is. La. Chat. 
**[You]** Ok? Ay. I don't know her. 
**[Other]** I feel like Asheville is like a fucking scene. 
**[You]** Yeah. I feel like you're not the first person to tell me about Stephanie, which is funny. I haven't been here that long. I've only been here for, like, a year and a half. We moved here. We've got two little kids, and so we were in LA and we were just. Like we got to get out of here. 
**[Other]** Where were you? In la. 
**[You]** We were all over Glendale for the last few years. Echo park before that. 
**[Other]** Including fire time. 
**[You]** Right. We left right before the fires. But we got to Asheville for the hurricane. 
**[Other]** Fuck. 
**[You]** So it was cool. We dodged one but got another. 
**[Other]** The other. That's funny. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** Crazy cool. I grew up in la. 
**[You]** Oh, word. What part? 
**[Other]** Off ball Holland. So basically half my life. On one side of the hill, half the other half in cena. 
**[You]** Hell, yeah. Dude. What's sick? 
**[Other]** Yeah, man. What about you? Where'd you grow up? 
**[You]** I grew up south of Boston. 
**[Other]** Co. Ol? 
**[You]** I was a little suburb called Sharon. I moved to America when I was seven. From ukraine. As the immigrant kid. That's some espresso there. What are we doing? Some espresso. 
**[Other]** No, it's water. 
**[You]** Okay? 
**[Other]** The coffee is done. I'm now hydrating, which I don't do well enough. It's a work in progress. 
**[You]** So you know, Saudi. You know, Paul, you're in the world of kind of weird Internet people. 
**[Other]** Exactly. I'm in that world. 
**[You]** Yeah. What's your. What's your weird Internet? Story. 
**[Other]** Good framing. You should make content. I guess my weird Internet stories. I worked at Vice for a decade. From 2009 to 2018. 
**[You]** I saw that. 
**[Other]** And then I left. 
**[You]** What were you doing there? 
**[Other]** Building whatever the next thing was for the company. I came in as like 22 year old intern who understood the Internet. And would work 80 hour weeks. And could, like, would do whatever it took. And then I just made myself reliable person. Then they, like, brought me along as, like, token millennial into the meeting because I could also make sure that, like, the presentation worked, you know? And then they eventually, like, let me write a couple slides, and then they eventually let me write the whole deck, and then they eventually let me present, and then they eventually, let me do real things. 
**[You]** Y. Eah. 
**[Other]** So it was really just that, you know, and, like, being precocious without being too annoying, or maybe annoying to my colleagues, but less annoying to my bosses, you know what I mean? 
**[You]** Nice. Total. Ly. My friend worked at Vice News. 
**[Other]** Who? 
**[You]** Sorry. The hbo show part. 
**[Other]** Got it. 
**[You]** He was one of the correspondents. That's really the only Vice connection. 
**[Other]** Which one? 
**[You]** Roberto ferdman. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Basically, by the time we got there, this dude Josh was running the news division, and he built his own parallel universe because that's what he likes to do. But that's cool. So the weird Internet stories. I left and then. When clubhouse was a thing. I got invited, I joined. I'd never done anything public. I never, like, created anything as I was behind the scenes. And then the conversation series that I started. Turned into being, like, one of the top 10 biggest clubs on the platform, and then I turned into one of the top hundred users, which is, like, a freaky, weird thing. Yeah. 
**[You]** What? 
**[Other]** I had, like, 300,000 followers. It was funny. And then, obviously, it all disappeared. But it was like. It was good. It worked. I learned a lot. Through that I met paul, I think. And then I did, like, a curiosity conversation thing with him, and then we kind of kept in touch a little bit here and there and, you know, That's the Paul thing. Sari I met. Honestly, I think that I reached out unprompted after she co wrote that thing. With, I think, Paki. It was like some, like, guest. Oh, no. Yeah. You know what they, like? Co wrote a post about a company called Fairmint. About, like, the future of investing or something like that. And I thought it was cool and, like, I reached out to her. I ended up investing in Fairmint as a consequence, at peace. Which is funny. And then I just, like, kept in touch with her, and then she told me about Spime or something. You know, like, I was, like, in the mix when it was startupy, very much like, you know, founding member, that kind of thing. And then I put in. I put in, like, a very small amount of money into the. Company to just, like, be like, I think you're awesome, and I want to, like, get the investor updates and be your friend. And then she's my friend. 
**[You]** Hell, yeah. That's amazing. Yeah, she's the best. 
**[Other]** That's how it works, right? Yeah, she's pretty cool. 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah. Yeah, she's great. 
**[Other]** I remember when she told me that you were going to start working on Sublime, and it was like, she's just like, I like him. He's my friend, he's awesome. And, like, we benefit massively from having him in the mix, so that's what we're doing. And I was like, that sounds good. 
**[You]** Yes, it's been fun. I mean, I've. I've. Lately, I haven't been as involved. I've been kind of. I've stepped back a little bit. I'm still involved, but just not like in the day to day. 
**[Other]** Sure. Yeah. 
**[You]** But. 
**[Other]** Well, the thing is evolving, you know, like, so the. Yeah. It'll. You maintain a tie. And then it just gets it. 's like. It's like mixing a record. Sometimes you move something up in the mix, sometimes you pull it back. You know? 
**[You]** Yeah, totally. And it's like. It's just a. I mean, that's kind of the whole thing with Sublime. That's their vibe. That's Saudi's whole thing. 
**[Other]** Correct. 
**[You]** It's like. You're just kind of flowing with it. 
**[Other]** Correct. So I saw Paul's post, and I've obviously, like, followed you and your work and all that stuff, and I'm like, It. Like I'd also not even installed cloud code when I booked it. But it was kind of funny because, like, basically, like, right after that, I did. And the last 72 hours have been the most productive of my life. 
**[You]** Oh, my God. Tell me more. That's incredible. 
**[Other]** In fact, I. Like, I had. I had Claude code. Right. Hold on, let me just check on something that was happening. Oh, yeah, no, that's good. 
**[You]** And you're using it in the terminal. 
**[Other]** Oh, yeah, dude, I'm like, I got multiple sessions open concurrently. 
**[You]** Okay? Thank God. Man. Thank God. The last one of these I did, because I've been doing them, and the last one. 
**[Other]** Oh, my God. They were using the browser interface on it. 
**[You]** No, this guy. I mean, bless, you know, whatever, but he hadn't done anything, which is fine. But then I was, like, trying to get him to use the terminal, and he, like, kept clicking on it and wouldn't use the. And it was just like, oh, this is. Like, there's just some people that this isn't going to work for, you know? And now. And now I kind of dread every conversation because I'm like, oh, like, am I doing something? So. So it's just nice to hear that you're, like, okay, you're, like, using it, you know? 
**[Other]** Oh, my God, that's so funny. 
**[You]** It makes me realize I need to just maybe be better about, like, communicating that you do have to have some willingness to. Because he would just be like, I can't. I don't. I don't know. It was like watching my dad or something. Or like someone. Someone's dad. But anyways, tell me. Tell me what you've been doing. 
**[Other]** Oh, no. So. Well, the funny thing is, I'm. Going. 
**[You]** I think you can just share screen. 
**[Other]** I did. Yeah. I'm going to share my screen, but I actually did something. Okay, I'm going to. Just let me look something up. System architecture explained. So not only have I. 
**[You]** This makes me so happy. I'm so excited to talk. Wow. 
**[Other]** Just wait. Just wait. You helped me generate this document. Oh, shit. Sorry. Command c or control c? You help me generate this document? It's amazing, but it's now out of date. Pull whatever context you need about that doc to understand the purpose of why we made it in the first place, then generate a new version. Do it quickly. I'm on a call. With someone, and I want to use this, talk them through. How? I've used Claude code not only to generate outputs, but to design a system for how I work. I want. This new version to also include some of the cool. To include, let's just say, not just the system that I've designed, but some of the outputs that I've achieved. Which will be available in to do and scoreboard. And maybe other places. I want this to be something that I can use to talk about what I've done, why I've done it, what I built, how I built it. The system for, like, producing the work, and the work produced as a consequence of that system. Go. So. 
**[You]** I was like. Felt like watching a musical performance. I was just like, wow, that was beautiful. I don't know if you need my help. 
**[Other]** Maybe. But maybe we could just be friends and trade notes and stuff. 
**[You]** Yeah. Jam. 
**[Other]** So. Exactly. So here I'm going to I have, dude, my adhd. I only got diagnosed last year, and I've, like, done some things in my life. Like I built a home office set up, and I have two screens now and, like, all this stuff, and I'm just, like, so happy. So I'VE just put you over here. 
**[You]** I mean, I honestly, like, I think I've been kind of developing this thesis that, like, I. Of all the kinds of people for whom this in particular is going to be great, like, because I have very, very intense adhd. And it's a particularly great. Right? Because. 
**[Other]** Okay? I've been saying the same thing. Go finish, and then so I don't interrupt, but yeah. 
**[You]** Well, just because, like, what happens with me is, like, I. I. I'm very bad at, like, the organization of ideas. And, but. But I. But I think that I can be good at it. And so what happens is that, like, I, like, decide to make all these fucking systems that I then abandon, but with this, I don't ever have to make the actual system. 
**[Other]** Correct. 
**[You]** You know, like, I just. I just, like. 
**[Other]** Or you can have two terminals open and use one for working on the thing that you're actually supposed to be working on, and then have the other one for making notes about it. 
**[You]** Yes. Y. 
**[Other]** And working on the system in parallel. And you can also do both in the same session when it makes sense. But, like, for things that are, like, outside of the focus of what, like, what I do is I use one session to actually do the thing that I'm trying to do, which is either work or meta work. And when the meta work Obviously my issue is the metal work always distracts me from doing the actual work I need to do. But when I'm doing the actual work and then there's contextually relevant meta work, I make notes about that in that same session. But then when I have ideas of things that would be like. 
**[You]** Es. Yes, yes, yes. Right. Yes. Yes. Yes, the meta work is. Yes. Yes. Yes. 
**[Other]** Deviations from the thing that I'm trying to do in that session. I could just dump it in the other session. And I've said this like, I've just done so much like learning about myself in the last year. And catalyzed by the adhd. And that diagnosis, by the way, was catalyzed by the fact that I broke after we had our kid. I just broke. It was like this because I used to be able to just work all the time. And then when I had, like, actual obligations to, like, humans and my partner and all that, it was like I broke. And she's like, you have to do something about it. And I was like. I was making jokes about having adhd. But like, now that I'm medicated, I take Stratera, by the way, which is like a non stimulant, and I'm like stoked on that. It's like that's the dream, at least for me. It's working now. And when I think about this moment, AI and all this stuff. Like. You. I'm sure. My mind is just. There's too much going on, and so I. I know that if I hold on to it, I'm going to feel overwhelmed. And if I externalize it? The problem with my externalization systems is I've gotten so overwhelmed. By the fact that I can't manage that externalized context. And I can't review properly. The systems don't talk to each other. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So, like the fact that I'm running Claude locally. It's my local files. I could just dump things into it. It remembers and pulls in the context. I can do the thing that I'm trying. To do. I could talk about how I'm doing the thing that I'm trying to do. I can remember other things. And I set up a skill called capture that just allows me to, like, brain dump whatever the. And then route it. 
**[You]** Yes, me too. I literally have one called capture. 
**[Other]** Yeah, Just to, like, route it wherever the it needs to go, like so. To that end, let me read you Claude's output on this systems architecture v2. The other thing that I've done in addition to the Claude CLI stuff is I re upgraded my account with IA Writer, which is like a beautiful markdown. Editor. 
**[You]** I like their thing a lot. Yeah. 
**[Other]** And they have, like, the very Japanese template PDF layout. So I have it on the dual mode, so I can write in it and I can see the PDF render, and it's gorgeous. There's probably stuff in here that would be a little bit embarrassing, so let me just see if. Yeah, if I can hold on. Will this clean it? Oh, yeah. Good. So okay. 
**[You]** I use obsidian, I think in the way that you use IA writer. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, right now. Okay, so I think that this is pretty. Good. I'm going to just. Okay? I'm just taking out some, like, sensitive financial data. And then. Cleaning it up. All right, so I'm going to actually just share this PDF with you, and I think that you'll like it. And I should honestly publish this out into the world. 
**[You]** Yeah. Do you have a place where you, like, publish that? 
**[Other]** Not really. I got to figure out my LinkedIn is the thing that's actually going to make sense for my business, which is annoying, but it is what it is. But I got to figure it out. 
**[You]** It's one thing. I can show you how I. What I've done. 
**[Other]** Oh, cool. Yeah, Sorry. Like, this is supposed to be me learning from you, but I'm not, like. 
**[You]** Because. No, no, no, no. It's your time. But I love learning. I love seeing. How people are because it's clear. I think what's becoming clear to me is, like, for some people, it just clicks. 
**[Other]** Dude. 
**[You]** And then for others, it's, like, very, very far from clicking. And then there's a big gap in the middle. And I think, like, I help people, like, cross the gap. And I have been like, with Paul, it was like. I did a call with him, and it was, like, clear that by the end of it, he was like, holy shit, this changes everything. Yeah. I'm like, that's. I think, where I can. Help people. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** But. Yeah. But then there's some people, like the guy I just talked to, where it's like, oh, I don't know, like. Like I can build stuff for that guy. And probably make money building something, but I. But I don't. But I don't think he wants really even to learn. 
**[Other]** Dude. 
**[You]** But maybe he think I don't know. Anyways, I'm just rambling. 
**[Other]** That's the funny thing is, like, I just know, like, there are all these, like, things that have been written about how. You know, this is going to be a runaway year where people who get it are going to, like, run away from people who don't. And it's just very, very true. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** I'm so excited to share this doc with you, so. 
**[You]** Yeah. Do you want. You can email it or WhatsApp. 
**[Other]** I'm going to. Yeah, I'll email it or whatever. Whatever works for you. 
**[You]** Yeah, that's my email. 
**[Other]** The meta client. Oh, my God, this is so funny. 
**[You]** I like the way you describe the meta work thing, because that's exactly it, you know, And I think my brain is always doing that. And often doing, and I've been that way since I was a kid. You know, the thinking about thinking thing. And then I'd be like, well, now I got to think about thinking about thinking about, you know. 
**[Other]** Dude. 100%. It's like. Was it turtles all the way down? It's like thinking all the way up. 
**[You]** Yeah, exactly. Exactly. 
**[Other]** Okay, so I think that I've now, like, gotten this clean. Enough. This is so fun. It's such a good, like, here's how I did xyz. Started work on a. Four. Okay? This is so funny. Okay, so I think. First proposal. Shit. Okay? Okay? I think I got it by client. This is so funny. I'm so wasting our time. But I think the satisfaction that I'll get from your reaction will be totally worth it. Okay, it's ready. I could do a little layout stuff, but I'm not going to bother with that. Cool. And then email. What email should I use for you? 
**[You]** I put it in the chat. There. Yeah, just my first name, last name. 
**[Other]** Okay, sorry. Chat. Oh, great. Check this out. 
**[You]** Wait. So how old is your kid done? Like two, One and a half. 
**[Other]** Three and a half. Oh, sorry. He's almost three. 
**[You]** Okay? Is it really hard? 
**[Other]** Yeah. It's hard. Yeah. His name is cass. He's awesome. 
**[You]** Love that name. Cass. 
**[Other]** And you have two. 
**[You]** Yeah. My son, Wilder, he's about to. He's gonna be five in a few months, and then my daughter. Em. Ma June is turning two in a week. 
**[Other]** How much you beautiful names. 
**[You]** Imogen. 
**[Other]** All right, so. Dude, so check your inbox. 
**[You]** I'm waiting. 
**[Other]** I'm like, trust me. It makes me feel so good about myself. And I, by the way, I need that, like, positive. Yeah. 
**[You]** Check this out. Damn. There it is. All right, here we go. I built what was pretty decent. That learns from my work. Yep. Everything. So this is the right? It's better. Value. Spunks really good. Skills. Nice. Revenue. 
**[Other]** The numbers are bullshit, but whatever. 
**[You]** Oh, okay. I was gonna say holy shit. Sessions completed. This isn't a toy. Yeah, I was looking at your company. It's rad. 
**[Other]** Thanks. 
**[You]** Self improvement. Scales, projects, score. I like scoreboard. 
**[Other]** Y. 
**[You]** I've not seen that. 
**[Other]** Ep. I'll tell you more about that. 
**[You]** The scoreboard is really. Yeah, that feels really interesting. The Constitution. Kick hops? Yeah. Load context from previous sessions every session. Checkpoint. 
**[Other]** Yeah. I started a skill called kickoff, which I use to, like, commence. And then I have something called checkpoint, which saves at a midpoint or when I'm leaving and I'm done the session. 
**[You]** Skill system, okay? Kickoff check. Flight, inside engine. Consolidate System R. Yeah. This is fucking sick, man. Front end design I use a lot. Prd. 
**[Other]** I've actually never used it. But I'm excited to get into it. 
**[You]** Yeah. I'll show you a couple things I've done with it. It's really sick. 
**[Other]** Fuck, yeah. 
**[You]** Each skill has its own learnings File. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's one of the biggest unlocks, right? Is like, the fact that every time I do something, I tell it to or have it run to? Like, what did we learn? Let's update the file. 
**[Other]** Correct. 
**[You]** And I do that also. 
**[Other]** You know what'd be really cool? It'd be really cool for, like, all the DOT files from one person's cloud account to then, like, chat with another person and be like, let's learn from each other's systems, like, 
**[You]** Totaling. 
**[Other]** What? That'd be cool. 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah. The To Do System One master file. So this is interesting because I don't have mine like this. Feel like I should maybe should. Completed. Yeah, by client. So I, I, I work at kind of like the. Well, I'll show you, but it's similar. Outcome deliverable. Dude, this is crazy that it made all of this. And then you have mercury. Yeah, yeah, airtable. Seed club. What's that? Migrated seed club. 
**[Other]** Whatever. That's one of my clients. 
**[You]** Yeah. Okay, cool, cool. Co. Ol continuous learning do work extract, store surface. Yes. Monthly consolidate. Yeah. Yeah. Learn from power. Yes, yes, yes. Key design. That's nice. See, even the fact of, like, looking at this is really cool, right? 
**[Other]** It's so cool, right? 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah. One thing, too, that I've. Update system is four days old. 
**[Other]** Isn't that so cool? 
**[You]** It's amazing. I can show you my kind of deal if. If you want. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Yeah. Dude, dude. All I did was basically come in hot and flex. How? Like, I've learned. But, yeah, I want to hear. I want to learn. Show me. 
**[You]** No, I. I love it. 
**[Other]** The only thing that's annoying is now that I actually know how to use it marginally, I'm just gonna be like, okay, now I'm gonna spend all my time. Designing and improving the system based on the things that you inspire me with. 
**[You]** Yeah. Well, that's good, though. 
**[Other]** I. Know. 
**[You]** Let me share screen. Okay? What do you do you use just like the Terminal app or another app? 
**[Other]** I'm just using the Terminal app. I thought a lot about it, but. And I also, like, read a bunch of stuff where people say that, like using Claude code in cursor or something like that. It just slows down your computer. Yeah. 
**[You]** No, I don't with that. Yeah. No, I mean. 
**[Other]** And I don't even. Not. Not visual studio code. Like, not vs code or anything like that. I'm straight up raw, doggot. 
**[You]** Like. No, I. Hell, yeah. I will say there are like there are. Like clones, Terminal clones that are pretty sick. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** Like ghosty and I use iterm too. 
**[Other]** I've heard. I term two. I did some research on those, and I was seeing someone. Maybe the person who created Ghost. Someone was talking about Ghostie. It was actually some dude that. I watched his YouTube video, but I just. I was like, let me just, like, not fuck with that yet, but maybe that's the next iteration. 
**[You]** Yeah. I would say, well, so the big thing that. Can you see my screen? 
**[Other]** Yep. 
**[You]** Okay? The big thing I use is Agent Deck. Have you tried this or heard about this? 
**[Other]** No. Is that software or is this. 
**[You]** It's. It's like a front end. What do they call them? 
**[Other]** Whoa. 
**[You]** Yeah. Dude. 
**[Other]** What software? What's the program that's open right now? 
**[You]** So the program is I term two. Which is just. Which is just a clone of Terminal. 
**[Other]** Wow. 
**[You]** Though. Like. 
**[Other]** So I term two basically allows you to. You're just using that as a clone of Terminal. And then this agent deck is like a GUI for Terminal. 
**[You]** Agent deck is. The yes. But. But not just that. But not just that, though. It's. It's. It's not. It's a. They call them TAMs or, like. Like, Basically, there's a way to, like, keep what you do in the terminal. 
**[Other]** Holy. 
**[You]** Persistent over beyond the session. 
**[Other]** Amazing because that's part of my issue with Claude, is I have to run this checkout process to, like, create persistent memory stuff. You know? 
**[You]** And you, you might still want to do, because it's not like this is like a thousand percent. 
**[Other]** Holy shit. 
**[You]** 2e is what it's called. It's like. It's. It's basically like, yeah. 
**[Other]** Terminal user interface. 
**[You]** But there's something. I forget what it's called, but there's, like, some tea mugs. That's it. And this is, like, a way to, like, keep a session over time. So basically what I was running into is, like, having way too many sessions open at once. And Agent Deck lets you organize all of your sessions. So I have. Each of these is an open session with Claude. 
**[Other]** I always get. In freaking out about how I should organize things. So can I ask Claude to organize this for me? 
**[You]** Yes. You can, but, like, only once, you've kind of made. It helped. It did do a lot of this organization, but I had a lot of the sessions already made. And created for myself. And you can see it's already gotten a little messy. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** But like. But basically. And some of them are dead. These two video content, analytics. Like, it's not running, but if I hit R and restart it, I think what we'll see. Once it starts, is. Is that. And then the other thing, too is, like, if I had something going with, like, five of these, you know, I'd be like, okay, so what do I do? And then I went back to the agent deck. You can see that's in green because it's, like, active. And so you can see how many things you have active, how many are idle, how many are dead. 
**[Other]** Are all of these. This is amazing. Are all of these different Claude Sessions? 
**[You]** Yes. Yes. So let me show like I can show you, and I'll do a new one. So I'll be like, this is in experiments. I can call. Oh, and that's the other thing. It doesn't have to just be clogged. So I can run. I can run Gemini open code. I mean, it's basically. It's just shell. It's just new windows, and so I. Can also run the shell if I need to do something in terminal that's not. But I could be like, you know, demo, whatever. And so this is going to start this up for me. 
**[Other]** Got it. 
**[You]** But if we go to, like, analytics, that thing that I just started. Hopefully. 
**[Other]** Yeah, one. One thing is just before. Before we wrap, I'm really interested in how you're using it in the content process of it all. 
**[You]** Oh, there it is. Yeah, so, like. Yeah. 
**[Other]** Because, like, a big. A big thing that I need to do is I need to go from, like, not creating content publicly to creating content publicly. 
**[You]** And what do you think your biggest. What's the biggest roadblock? 
**[Other]** Getting fucking psychological, like. I've actually diagnosed this. So, like, it is. Fear failure. Fear of judgment, feel of people saying, you know, that they don't like me or whatever. Like, I wrote this somewhere. Actually, I wrote it and I said it to my therapist, so I'll say it to you. Because you're my new therapist. Not here. Let's see. I wrote it down. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** Here. Because then I read it to her and it was funny. 
**[You]** I. Love reading stuff tonight. Therapist. 
**[Other]** Where did I write it? See, this is. I could just ask Claude if I did a good job with this. Oh, all right, whatever. I'll find it, and it'll be fun to tell you when I found it, but the reality is, like, I'm afraid that I'm gonna say something, that people are like, oh, that guy's stupid, or whatever, and then I'm, like, frozen about not knowing what to create content about, but. I know that all the context lives in all the work that I'm doing. And I think that the real unlock is going to be. Not staring at, like, a blank. Thing input field and being like, what am I gonna write? And it's having the system help me generate this stuff, and then I can start to just look at it a bit, a little bit like a game, and if I can depersonalize from the outcomes, be like, oh, I tried that. Like, how do I make it like I'm playing a video game and I'm trying to, like, jump over the lava pit? Oh, that technique didn't work. So let me just try this. So I need, like, something to help depersonalize it a bit. And I do think that Claude, as a sort of. Thing is going to help. I'm going to start with text post. Then I'll get into making them graphical, and then I'm going to work my way up into doing video stuff because I know I have to. 
**[You]** And the text would probably be, like, on LinkedIn. 
**[Other]** LinkedIn. I'm not even going to try doing fucking Twitter right now, just given where it is. And, like, the thing that's going to be good for my business is LinkedIn, so I'm just going to do that. 
**[You]** Okay? So I'll show you. My. I've got a couple workflows that I think are really good for this. I mean, one, I. So I have my social hq. And let me just see where this is at. Rem. Ime. This works. Do you have a voice for me? Like, I create a lot of, like, because I have a lot of clients who I write for and do content for, so I create a lot of, like, voice guides. 
**[Other]** Great. 
**[You]** And so that's helpful. But basically I then have it link to the type fully API. Do you know? Type fully. 
**[Other]** Yeah, Yeah, I have an account. 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah. So. So I can. So I can be like. Yeah. Create a voice. Well, when we build social, execute. 
**[Other]** So you could say, great, ship it, and then you can immediately schedule it. 
**[You]** Cool. Co. Ol? Write me a post and schedule it. 
**[Other]** Insightfully. 
**[You]** Right now for socials. 
**[Other]** All right, hold on. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** Before that goes. I create a voice profile where we started. Da, da, da. Your voice find what you do, what you don't do. The test fight. Do you have, like, gold samples and all that shit? Okay, rewrite one of your coworkers. 
**[You]** Yeah. So this is the. This is the profile, you know? 
**[Other]** Great. It's like Cloud MD just for voice only, basically. 
**[You]** Yeah, but I do that kind of for everything where I kind of create guides a lot. So it's like I'm. I'm creating, and it seems like you're doing this, but I don't know if you create, like, specific documents where I'll be like, okay, make a doc that you. Reference. Step one, dog poop on the path. 
**[Other]** Well, it's part of the social HQ skill. I got it. This is how. 
**[You]** Y. Es. Yes. But I don't think social hq is a skill. Oh, no. It is. It is. You're right. My bad. You're right. 
**[Other]** It is. I just saw it in the thing that you had pulled up has the directory structure. 
**[You]** Oh, okay. Cool, cool, cool. Yeah. This is weird because typefully. Okay, cool. So it. It's scheduled it into typeflame for me. I do. And then I would just have to go in here and. 
**[Other]** Amazing. 
**[You]** Whatever, you know, post. Yeah, it can't do images yet, so I have to drag those in myself. But, you know, whatever. 
**[Other]** Oh, that's so good. 
**[You]** But. 
**[Other]** Yeah, it can at least create. You can create an image and you can at least dump it in a folder that you can just drag it in, right? 
**[You]** Exactly. And then you can use also like the chrome. Have you used the chrome extension much? Okay, so that's really insane, where I can be, like, browse. 
**[Other]** I have an insult. Then. 
**[You]** My LinkedIn for what people are talking about today or whatever. So I think it will probably use Chrome for this. 
**[Other]** Can it pull in your LinkedIn bookmarks. Your saved posts. 
**[You]** I don't know. 
**[Other]** I'll try that and I'll let you know. 
**[You]** Yeah. I also have something called. 
**[Other]** So the cloud cli can speak to the claude chrome extension. 
**[You]** Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so. Yeah, so it can not just speak to it. It can, like, just run it. 
**[Other]** Okay, so basically, it's browser use. 
**[You]** 's. It's doing this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I. So I've been using this a lot. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Oh, my God. 
**[You]** It's pretty crazy. And you can see. You know, it's doing its thing. 
**[Other]** I'm going to send you something before I forget. 
**[You]** So that's pretty sick. I also use something called apify. Apif Y. Okay, yeah, so I've been using. 
**[Other]** Yep, I know. Apify. But I haven't. I'm not like a power user. I need a. I need to spend more time with it. 
**[You]** How to use it much either. I use. I use a lot of this stuff through the API. Through their API, where I'm not even, like, learning how to use the tools. 
**[Other]** Yeah. Apify is good for scraping. 
**[You]** Exactly. Exactly. So I've been doing some of that. And then. 
**[Other]** Save that Reddit post for later. By the way, just the one that I sent you. 
**[You]** Okay? It's in here. Okay, cool. That's another kind of random, funny kind of cool thing that I have. I built something that sends me a briefing. Every couple, twice a day on what's happening in our our cloud code. Which is pretty sick. 
**[Other]** Oh, cool. Wait. How? So you built that in cloud code? 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah. 
**[Other]** Like a claude code subreddit. 
**[You]** It analyzes it. Yeah. And then it sends an email. And it sends the email using something called loops, which is another tool that I use. This is like what I use now to send my emails. 
**[Other]** Rundown. 
**[You]** And are actually. No way. It might be recent. I use both, but they're both. Yeah, I use resend, and this is all automatic. 
**[Other]** Holy shit. You should find a pipe this stuff into beehive too, and then you could just monetize it. 
**[You]** I know. I mean, I could. You can make like. Yeah. Cuz beehive has. Beehive has an API, right? 
**[Other]** Holy. Yeah, and I'm friends with the guy who runs it. 
**[You]** Yeah. Tyler. 
**[Other]** No, tyler's the founder and CEO. I mean, the guy that runs the API. 
**[You]** Oh, okay, cool. 
**[Other]** All the integrations. 
**[You]** Cool, cool. Yeah, I know Francis over there. I know one guy. 
**[Other]** Francis is. I'm going to see. Yeah, he's a super good dude. 
**[You]** He's the man. He interviewed me for their, like, creator spotlight thing, which is awesome. 
**[Other]** Oh, that's cool. 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah. 
**[Other]** Did you do a podcast episode or just. 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
**[Other]** I'll watch it. That's cool. 
**[You]** Yeah. What he wrote. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** This is like my. I made, like, an alternate character called Brad C. On version. Who's, like, all of my, like, worst traits about conversion, you know, bullshit. Anyways. 
**[Other]** That's funny. 
**[You]** What else was I going to. Okay, so. 
**[Other]** We were talking about. Yeah, whatever. 
**[You]** So the other big thing that this is, if you want to have your own blog and stuff, 
**[Other]** You're using instead of Spotlight. By the way, I forgot the thing that everyone says that you should use. 
**[You]** Raycast. Raycast. 
**[Other]** Raycast. Yeah. 
**[You]** I've heard that spotlight's pretty good now, but I. I've just. I'm like, yeah. 
**[Other]** I think that Apple just keeps stealing from Raycast, basically. 
**[You]** Exactly. But I think, I think Grayhouse is still better. I do use it a lot less now that I use cloud code. I think I have a theory that, like, a lot of these companies, like Raycast, like, Lovable, it's different, but I think a lot of them are going to, like, go under because everyone's just going to use, like, the main tool. Like, you don't need all of these layers. 
**[Other]** You don't need all these abstractions. Yeah, and that's why I'm not even going to start with Obsidian, because I've done this too many times. 
**[You]** Exactly. I think Obsidian is basically what IA writer is for you, right? It's just like a layer. It's how you see the text that you're saving on all your markdown files. What I really like about it. Is this is my way that I post stuff to my blog. I have a ready to publish folder and anything I put in here. You know, so if I was like, Without words. Okay, can I start? Let's move things. If I take this and put it into ready to publish. And then I have a keyboard shortcut for this. It's called Glob, which, if I type that in, it should run a script. And it says, found new files to publish? Yes. So this should theoretically just push right to my both Arturu.com blog. It hasn't. Yeah, so I use netlify. 
**[Other]** Waiting for a deployment. Yeah. 
**[You]** To host my blog. 
**[Other]** This is like the next stage for me is basically figuring out my publishing ecosystem. And you don't have a cms? Or are you just publishing Straight and markdown, basically? 
**[You]** Should be in here. Hey, there it is. 
**[Other]** Yay. 
**[You]** So it's called Hugo. It's like a simple static site thing. I think Claude is being weird because it's still browsing the Internet. Yeah, it's called Hugo, which is just like a framework, and then there's a theme called Paper Mod, all of which I just grabbed from GitHub, but basically it takes what you have in Markdown and converts it. Into what it needs to make a post, and it knows how to grab images. And all of that is like pipe hooked up to go from Obsidian or from like a markdown file folder. To my blog. But what's cool about that too, that I think you might like, is when I type my capture command, it will create a blog post that it puts into Obsidian for me. That I can then just drag into my folder to publish it. Do you know what I mean? 
**[Other]** So I'm just making a note. In Granola to make sure. Here's what I wrote down. I said, give me a list of all the tools Alex mentioned with context on what he uses them for and how he uses them. Give me a summary and direct quotes. Because you're just saying all these things that I'm not going to want. To forget. 
**[You]** So1. Actually, now that you've mentioned that, too, one thing that I do with Granola is I like. I really don't like that. How they summarize things. Because it's like, I feel like I lose so much context, so I always copy the full transcript. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** And put and give it to cloud code and have it save the full transcript. Into that client's folder so that I can I have a full record of every conversation with every client. And then I actually found a way that, like, I can do that automatically. It can, like, just pull from, like, some stuff from Granola, like cash, local cash. So basically. I just use Granola for the transcription. But not the like their service. 
**[Other]** So the funny thing is, I am doing something similar. Where I've created some sort of script to pull from the Granola API the full transcripts. 
**[You]** Okay? Sick. 
**[Other]** And I just dump them in locally. But what I need to do, one of the things that I know that I need to do is essentially find a way. I think I even wrote this as, like, a to do. Because I also use this CRM tool called Clarify, which has a meeting recorder. And I have both running. It's clarify AI. It's really cool. 
**[You]** Okay? 
**[Other]** And they have a native meeting recorder, but it's not as reliable as Granola is. So really the thing that they actually have a quote from me. On the fucking website, which is cool. I don't have a face, though. I don't think. So maybe I got deprecated. The system that I want to basically build. Is this? For every meeting on my calendar. Or any time that I enter whatever server Google Meet or whatever. Have Granola or clarify run. If both run, then look at both transcripts. And see which one is longer. Because maybe one cut out or something like that and then use the longer one Clarify when it's running. Also captures the video. Which I can then potentially use for object recognition. Stuff like if someone's presenting slides or presenting something, I can extract from that. 
**[You]** Wow. 
**[Other]** And then if it's clarified, Granola, whatever, both will have meeting summaries. Clarifies meeting summaries are not as good as Granola. Granola allows you to have some templates. So basically, get the raw transcript, get whatever version of the meeting summary that I want. Put that into local file storage somehow. Then find a way to make sure that Claude Code knows, number one, where that local file storage is, and number two, that there is something new in there. And then in the event that it's in a folder, That is relevant for whatever purpose. Don't ingest everything into memory, but know if there are things that are titled in a certain way or whatever that pertain to particular projects or something that you have pull that stuff in because that's something that it should pull in. To then get its own summary to keep in the cloud context. So that's like, something that I'm working on. But, yeah, the goal is fucking. Why are everything to everything else? 
**[You]** Yeah, I've been doing that a lot. With? I kind of call them like chief of staffs or whatever. Where, like. I'll. You know, I have, like, my big chief of staff that knows everything about all of my. All of my things. But then I have, like, for this AI stuff I'm doing. I have. A chief of staff there often. What I'll be, what I'll do is I'll like. 
**[Other]** Like a project level chief of staff. 
**[You]** Yeah. And I'll tell them to, like, send stuff to each other because they all have inboxes. And so, like, you know, if I'm, like, working, it's that meta thing. It's not like I'm working on something. And I'm like, man, I need to make sure my chief of staff knows this. I'll be like, just tell my chief of staff that. And then the chief of staff has that in its inbox waiting. Next time I have it run and check its inbox the next time I'm working at that level. So it's like each level of abstraction or whatever. Has. Its own kind of like inbox. You know? 
**[Other]** Yes, I feel like I am doing a little bit of that, and I want to figure out more about the degree to which my system is currently doing that. I think I have master level to dos, and then I have a project level to do. And I would imagine that that's probably a resource. That if and when I build a chief of staff agent, it can call on that and then do other things. But the thing is, I haven't built any agents. I've only been building skills and different processes. So I've not yet gotten to that level, But I just know that agents rely on skills, and skills are not just skills, but it's the documentation of processes. So I felt like figuring out some of the core skills. Is number one most important. And then the other thing is I have this thing where there's a Patterns MD folder. And so patterns pays attention to things that don't yet it's patterns and things that are recurring. But then if I do the same thing over and over, there's actually a skill graduation curve where if I do the same thing multiple times, it's like, you should graduate this to a skill. Let's upgrade it. 
**[You]** I love that. What? Like, I don't. I don't understand what an agent is. Is that just something? 
**[Other]** So structurally agents. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** What they did with the skills ecosystem, which is so smart is a skill is just a capability or the documentation of a process. And an agent can call on one or more skills. But because agents are separate or because skills are separate. 10 different agents can all have the same set of skills or some set. So it's like every agent is like a character that you can give character attributes to, and the skills are the character attributes and the process attributes. So essentially. I can have three chief of staff. You know how fucking aria Manuel has, like, seven assistants or whatever. I can have two chief of staffs. That each have the same set of project management skills, but I can give one. I can give them different personalities, but I can also have one focus on a specific set of skills. 
**[You]** Right. 
**[Other]** For what it's focused on, which is, like, I don't know, project management and calendar management. And then another one can be really focused on my ghost writer. Ha. They could be focused on different functional areas, and I don't need to give them all the same set of skills. So skills are like atomic composable units that you can then give to agents to then run. 
**[You]** But. But, like, okay. And so the. The idea is the agent has, I guess, agency, right? It's like it's doing things. 
**[Other]** Correct. And I think it's structurally incorrect to focus on. Putting skills into the agent. You want skills to be atomic units, discrete from an agent. And an agent can call on skills because then skills become composable. And they're not like, lost, buried in the context of an individual agent. 
**[You]** Got it. Got it, got it, got it. So agents are like nouns and skills are like verbs. 
**[Other]** Skills or verbs or, like, adjectives or, like, whatever, you know what I mean? 
**[You]** Yeah, I. I haven't really played with agents. I feel like I treat them the way I treat mcps. 
**[Other]** So is your chief of staff just a skill? Got it. 
**[You]** Because I don't know when I would ever want to run in as an agent. Or maybe. 
**[Other]** I don't know yet. 
**[You]** That's what I mean. That's what I'm trying to figure. It's like, what does that actually mean? Like, when would you? I think one time I heard it described as an agent is something that you, like, you send to go do something and you don't have to be around. But I don't know what I would want when I would. What I would want that to be yet. 
**[Other]** Correct. I use disposable agents. Right now when I am asking it to research something. So spin up sub agents to go research this. Or spin up three sub agents to redeem this proposal. And here's what I'll do. I'll say spin up 10 sub agents. To red team disposal and then spin up one Orchestrator agent. To coordinate all the feedback from all of them and then bring it back to me. So I don't have agents, but I have disposable agents that I'll run in certain processes. And I think that what I'm going to probably need to tell Claude Code to do is to actually help me. Build a graduation that I'm using agents. 
**[You]** Got it. Got it. 
**[Other]** So basically pay attention to how I'm sitting code and how and when I'm using agents, and based on those needs, make recommendations on formal agents that I should create. Also, even when not using agents specifically, but you're noticing patterns. Where having an agent makes sense. Make those recommendations to me. And so when I run the kickoff process, you can say it's time to create some agents. Let's start. Let's do this, that, the other thing, and then diagnose if those agents have the requisite skills or if I should be sorry. Calls. You can't see me for a sec. That agent doesn't have the skills. Maybe I need to create some skills, and then I can keep building this loop where I'm auditing all of my other that agent or my other. 
**[You]** Yeah, that's a cool thing that I don't do a lot of yet, either. 
**[Other]** The validation stuff, I think is really important. 
**[You]** Have you heard of. Have you heard of the Ralph Wiggum thing? 
**[Other]** Deployed again. Nuts. But I'm ready for that at some point. 
**[You]** I mean, my whole thing is like trying all of this stuff for non coding, you know, so I've like, I've tried doing. So I tried doing that with like, you know, cop, like social copy. I've been like, Ralph Wiggum, the social copy, until you're sure it's good, you know. And. 
**[Other]** Have you enjoyed your experience with that so far? 
**[You]** I mean, yeah, it, like, won't really do it. It'll be like. It'll be like, that's really a coding thing. But we'll, like, pretend like we're going to do it for you. And. And it does. I mean, it does get better results, right? It's like, it's sort of just. I think it's another version of being like, let's set the bar really, really high. Right, as opposed to like, which, like, you do have to do. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** Because if you don't, it, like, won't, right? 
**[Other]** So. Just being mindful of time. What is the way that you like to talk to people? 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. 
**[Other]** Have I graduated sufficiently into? 
**[You]** Yes. Yes. The graduation curve. Let's. Let's shoot the. 
**[Other]** How do you want to do text? 
**[You]** Mean, I like text or WhatsApp. Yeah. Yeah. 
**[Other]** What's your number? 
**[You]** Four zero one. 4, 5, 4, 5, 1, 3, 6, 2. Two. 
**[Other]** Hey, it's sterling. Okay, cool. So now. Hello. Oh, I can hear you now. Okay, you. 
**[You]** I'm back. 
**[Other]** Back. It's funny because I feel like obviously there are areas where you're, like, light years ahead of me or. 
**[You]** Definitely. Yeah. 
**[Other]** This moment. This is like the moment that I've been waiting for my whole fucking life. I feel like the world just finally met me where I am. Do you know what I mean? 
**[You]** I do. 
**[Other]** There's been something wrong with me, and I didn't know what it was. And part of it was not having an ADHD diagnosis, not having any of the tools to deal with it, not having medication, having the voice inside my head really just fucking me up in ways that I wasn't even really aware of until I started taking meds. And then even with that, The way that the tools and software and system, the way that it was all designed, just wasn't mapped to the way that. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** It wasn't like a bespoke suit. You know what I mean? I was still trying to look good in some off the rock shit. And it just didn't work. The leg pants were too short or something like that. And it feels like it was fucking made for me. And I'm happier and more content because I'm more productive, and I feel like. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** It works for me. 
**[You]** There's a flow to it. There's like a. Yeah. 
**[Other]** Yeah. And I'm just proud of my days at work. And when's the last time I fucking felt proud of a day of work? 
**[You]** I know. I think there's a. Yeah. 
**[Other]** So do you have something similar happening with you? Because I wonder if it's ADHD specific thing or if it's just like my own psychology or whatever the fuck. 
**[You]** There's definitely a lot of that. And for me, there's also the sort of inverse or sort of. I don't know, like a trepidation, like a wariness to. I think, because I've, like, I have a brand on the Internet or whatever as, like, this sort of, like, comedian guy. 
**[Other]** All right. 
**[You]** This kind of, like, idiot guy. 
**[Other]** Yeah. 
**[You]** This feels different. And I think. I don't know, there's like a dissonance in how I, like. I don't know what to do. Where I'm like. I can't just say. Well, I'm like. 
**[Other]** Say more about that. 
**[You]** I don't know. I'm like. I can't just, like, turn both our true my substack into so I, like, started a separate one. You know? 
**[Other]** Hello. I see, I see. Wait, sorry. Do you have a meeting now? Or you could a little bit. 
**[You]** I have, like, 10 minutes. 
**[Other]** Okay, good. So since we're off the fucking clock and I feel like I melt as much value as I could out of that time, Let's just turn it back on you. So tell me more, because it's funny, because. I want you to continue the train of thought that you're on, but I also want you to answer it in the context of like, okay, fine, you're spending less time with Sublime, you're writing. Whatever. What does the ideal. Allocation of time look like? When you've been incredibly successful this year, what are you spending your time on? What are you doing? How are you making your money? What is your life? Look like because my business. You said you read the website, so my little essay. 
**[You]** That's what you do. 
**[Other]** I'm building a business to help. Yeah. I want you to spend the highest percentage of time in your zone of genius, because then you're happy, and then the world's getting the maximum benefit from the great things that you are capable of doing. 
**[You]** I mean. Right now. What I do is a lot of, like, client stuff, and it's. Some of it's cool. 
**[Other]** Ghost writing. 
**[You]** Somewhat. Some is like podcast editing, podcast, whatever. Like, a lot of stuff with this one client. And, yeah, it's like ghost writing for the founders of this company. Including one of them has a podcast. So I, like, kind of do a lot for it, including editing it. Doing social clips, social editing. 
**[Other]** Are you also prepping him for it and doing, like, research and framing and talking points? 
**[You]** A little bit. A little bit. I'm, like, helping shape the fold the whole show. Because it's like, really? 
**[Other]** Right. And then you're handling a lot of the actual physical post production. And delivery. Like you're editing and you're publishing. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** Oh, dude, we gotta, like. I'll tell you another time that we talk about my big fucking grand vision, which I'm not really telling many people, but I want to build using the tools that I'm using. Jarvis, the heads up display the operating layer. For creators to. Run a really efficient media company. So actually managing the post production workflow for podcasts, which is stuff that my partner and I have done, Is on the list of things to figure out. 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah. 
**[Other]** You know what I mean? 
**[You]** I mean, it's. It's wild. I literally got halfway through building my own version of Cap Cut the other day. Because cap cut sucks. 
**[Other]** Oh, my God. 
**[You]** And for captions and captions is a big part of what I have to do. 
**[Other]** It does. 
**[You]** I found somebody else to help me do it. But everybody needs that. Everybody wants that. But anyways, so I do that. And then I have both are true, which is my substack, which makes like 10 grand a year right now, which is crazy, right? Like, I'm an artist who, like, makes real money on my own work. 
**[Other]** Almost a grand a month. So the goal is get it to 1k mrr then get it to 2 and a half grand mri then. 
**[You]** Totaling, but it's like. It's hard, man. It's hard asking people for money to support your creative comedy writing. It's a lot easier to ask them to be like. To be like, hey, I can help you with cloud code. And I've already made. A quarter of that 10. You know, I've already made, like, about. About three grand this year on the Claude code stuff. You know, and it's like, I haven't done much of anything. It's been like one tweet and a couple emails. 
**[Other]** Have you thought about. 10 Xing or 5 Xing? How much he charged for these sessions? 
**[You]** Well, so I just did, like, an email for a cohort based thing. It's 500 bucks for five weeks. Five people and. I think the last. There was one spot left, and I think it's. It just got filled. 
**[Other]** Oh, fuck, yeah. Great. Because that's always like, move number one is just charge more. 
**[You]** Totally total. 
**[Other]** Charge until you feel, like, really uncomfortable and then charge a little bit more than that. 
**[You]** Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think I could get there with all of this stuff. But I think to. To the point that we were talking, you know, starting this off with is like, there's like a. There's this sort of pure creative guy that I don't want to lose, and I don't. I worry that people. 
**[Other]** Right. You don't want to create another fucking AI Think boy. 
**[You]** Yeah, yeah. And A.I. exactly. And so it's like. And some people I know, people who read both are true are, like, pretty anti AI, you know, which is fine. 
**[Other]** Persona. For sure. 
**[You]** But it is like a thing of. It's funny, like, I feel like I spent the first 10 years after graduating college, like, being good at the business stuff. For startups and, like, techie or whatever, and, like, wanting desperately for people to think I was an artist. And now I, like, people think I'm an artist, and now I, like, worry that they're going to think I'm the other thing again, you know? Whereas, like, literally, my thing is called both are true. And the whole point is that both things can be fucking true. 
**[Other]** That's so funny. 
**[You]** But that's the work. That's the work. 
**[Other]** Just to play back what I'm hearing and maybe say the obvious thing. Isn't there a world where both are true? Is the documentation of your journey to use technology and things like that to help you build a sustainable career doing the creative work that you love. And isn't like one of the big sort of frames, problems, opportunities of our time. The fact that every artist needs to become an entrepreneur. So to me, the fact that both are true and everything you're describing to me. Is set. The stage is set for that frame. Again, the catalyst for me starting the business. A big part of it is I read that book the Death of the Artist, by Bill deroitz, who writes for the New Yorker. And there's a line in there where he says, the good news is you can do it all yourself. The bad news is that you have to. Right. So. You're on that journey. And the fact that you can straddle both worlds and you're credible in both worlds. You context switch, you code switch. But this is almost like the documentation of trying to find the connection point between the two hemispheres of your brain. 
**[You]** Rather than making it its own thing. 
**[Other]** It's like the work is being, you know, comedy writer, and the meta work is like building a business to support that. So going back to that work and meta work thing, and you're like, live blogging that journey. Going from almost 1k. Mrr. That's the actual like. Because the scoreboard for you is like, how much money am I making? How much recurring revenue am I making from my creative work? And you're almost at 1 kr. Mrr. You're like $833 a month. Get to 1k, get to 2 and a half k, get to 10k, right? Get to the point where, like, you're fucking above the waterline, you're home free. And by the way, let's just be friends. Let's make this a case study. Like I'm trying to build the tools and the systems and the maps and the fucking everything to architect a world for you to do that. So let's just fucking collab on it. 
**[You]** I would love that. 
**[Other]** Be a guinea pig and let me help you make more money. 
**[You]** I mean that this. That'd be very sick. 
**[Other]** Okay, cool. Fuck, yeah. Great. 
**[You]** And you think that's it's better to keep that all inside of both our true verses? My like, little side. 
**[Other]** Well, maybe I'm just saying something with a really strong opinion. Pretending that it's, like, the correct answer. It might be, but I think that because it's what I plan to do. And so maybe I'm just being sort of imposing my own worldview on you, but I want to talk about the ethics of AI. And the fact is that. Let's unpack that shit because. You can be a Luddite and say, this doesn't work because it's going to displace jobs because this at whatever. And you could be an ethical Luddite and say, guess what? It's because of the original sin of the training data and this and that, whatever. But I also think, and this is my own worldview is like, you can think about the application of AI in different contexts, you can think about it in business operations. You can think about it in creative operations, then you could think about it in creative production. And I think that the biggest ethical issue that everyone has, understandably so, is in the creative production and the displacement of stuff. But is it unethical for creative people to use it in business operations or creative operations? Is it unethical for you to fucking add subtitles? There's actually a lot of stuff that people call AI that's been around for decades. It's just called computers. 
**[You]** Min. Totally Google. Google is AI, you know, it always has been. 
**[Other]** Yeah, exactly. You as an artist, if that's like, the core of your identity with the sort of business person, rapper or whatever, as you kind of move through the dimension of time. You're wrestling with that. And I'm going to talk about how I'm wrestling with that from the business standpoint, to support people like you. 
**[You]** Right. Right. 
**[Other]** But you're going to talk about you could. I think I'm interested how you as an artist. That's the desired outcome, the future state, the future you that you want to build towards, where you can just fully fucking identify as an artist making enough money that you could just say, fuck all y'all work on other stuff that I want to. How do you get there? You're unequivocally going to have a higher shot of getting there and getting there faster using AI. So how do you ethically use it, and how do you have that conversation publicly? So you can even give people who currently have a surface level, unnuanced understanding of it an opportunity to give them mental models to think about how they might. Because guess what? The folks that are ethical Luddites are going to get lapped. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** And it's like it's bad for them. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** And there's got to be a way to have both things be true. Which is like there is an original sin of how these companies acquired their training data. It's not fucking fair use. That's bullshit. If they were doing in a pure research context, fine. But if you're building trillion dollar companies on the back of it, fuck you. 
**[You]** Yeah. Yeah. 
**[Other]** But also we're there. And you're not going to put the genie back in the bottle. So what are you going to do, just sit this one out? It's a replatforming of fucking society. 
**[You]** Have you heard of. Have you listened to Jared Lanier about all this stuff? Do you know him? Yeah. 
**[Other]** So I've read his works. I've met him a couple times, been to his lectures and stuff. I haven't read anything of his properly since you wrote that book who Owns the Future. But I'm probably due for another deep dive in his world. 
**[You]** He's gone a lot about this particular original sin concept of just, like, what do we do? His whole thing is like, you should pay people for the stuff of theirs that you use. Yeah. 
**[Other]** 100%. How do you do attribution to that? 
**[You]** He's trying to figure it out. 
**[Other]** Don't know. Great. 
**[You]** Yeah. 
**[Other]** Cool. I mean, I love that. I think that there's no question to me, and I think that one of the potential solves is. All of these Companies should donate 10% of their equity to organizations like nonprofits that support creative people and stuff like that. And some of it's coming from academics, some of it's coming from coding, some of it's coming from creative work. But anyone that's doing creative work, like Runway, 10%. Of your fucking equity. Or, like, Google for anything that you get from nanobanana, 10%, whatever. Just fucking do it. 
**[You]** And just be smart and they can. Yeah. 
**[Other]** Just be smart. 
**[You]** Okay? 
**[Other]** Like there's a creative industry. Go, go. Do you think we'll talk more later? 
**[You]** I have to run in a second, but I would like to keep talking. Man, this is awesome. 
**[Other]** Likewise. 
**[You]** All right. I'll talk to you soon, dude. Thank you. 
**[Other]** See you later. Bye. 
**[You]** By. E.
