# Creative HQ

This is your creative operations folder. Everything lives here in plain text.

## How This Works

You talk to Claude. Claude reads these files. You work together.

**The files:**
- `tasks.md` — What you're working on
- `ideas.md` — Brain dumps, half-baked thoughts, things to explore
- `inbox.md` — Things that need attention but aren't sorted yet
- `projects.md` — Your active projects and their status
- `contacts.md` — People in your world who might help
- `wins.md` — Things that worked (so you remember what works)

**The commands:**
- `/deck` — Quick visual dashboard of everything
- `/chief-of-staff` — Give me a full briefing on everything
- `/daily` — What should I focus on today?
- `/brain-dump` — I have messy thoughts, help me sort them
- `/who-can-help` — Find people in my network for what I'm working on
- `/win` — Record something that worked
