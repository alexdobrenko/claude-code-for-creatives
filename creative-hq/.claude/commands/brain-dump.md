# Brain Dump Processor

I have messy thoughts in my `ideas.md` file. Help me sort them.

## Instructions

1. Read everything in `ideas.md`
2. For each idea/thought, figure out where it belongs:
   - **Task?** → Add to `tasks.md`
   - **Project idea?** → Add to `projects.md` as a new project
   - **Relates to existing project?** → Add as a note under that project
   - **Contact to reach out to?** → Add to `contacts.md`
   - **Something that worked?** → Add to `wins.md`
   - **Still half-baked?** → Leave it in `ideas.md` with a note

3. Show me what you're moving where and ask if it looks right before making changes

4. After sorting, clean up `ideas.md` — remove the things that got moved, keep what's still brewing

Be opinionated. If something sounds like a task, call it a task. I can always move it later.
