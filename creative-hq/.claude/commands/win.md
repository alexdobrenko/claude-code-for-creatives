# Record a Win

Something worked. Let's capture it before I forget.

## Instructions

1. Ask me: "What happened?"
2. Listen to my answer (might be rambly, that's fine)
3. Ask: "Why do you think it worked?"
4. Based on my answers, create a wins.md entry with:
   - Today's date
   - A short title
   - What happened (cleaned up from what I said)
   - Why it worked (my theory)
   - What to do again next time

5. Add it to `wins.md`
6. Celebrate briefly — this stuff matters

Keep the entry short. 3-5 sentences max. The point is to capture the pattern, not write an essay.
