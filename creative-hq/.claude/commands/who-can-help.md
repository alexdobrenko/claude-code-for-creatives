# Who Can Help

I need to find the right person for something I'm working on.

## Instructions

1. Read my `contacts.md` file
2. Read my `projects.md` to understand what I'm working on
3. Ask me (if not obvious): "What do you need help with?"
4. Search my contacts for people who might be relevant based on:
   - What they're good for
   - Their audience/reach
   - How I know them (warm connection?)

5. Suggest 1-3 people with a SHORT explanation of why

6. If I don't have anyone relevant, say so — and suggest what kind of person I should be looking for

**Bonus:** If it makes sense, offer to draft an outreach message to them.
