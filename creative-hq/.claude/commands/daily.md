# Daily Check-in

Help me figure out what to focus on today.

## Instructions

1. Read my `tasks.md` and `projects.md` files
2. Look at what's marked as "Today" or urgent
3. Consider my current project statuses
4. Give me a SHORT answer:
   - **The ONE thing** that would make today a win
   - **2-3 other things** I could realistically do
   - **What to ignore** today (permission to let stuff slide)

Keep it brief. I don't need a long explanation — just tell me what to do.

If my tasks file is empty or unclear, ask me what's on my mind first.
